The Danger 
Hijacked People
• Hackers can set up open “rogue” 
wireless hotspots posing as a genuine 
wireless network.
• Rogue wireless hotspots are also known 
as “evil twin” hotspots.

12

The Danger
Ransomed Companies
• Employees of an organization are often lured 
into opening attachments that install 
ransomware on the employees’ computers.
• This ransomware, when installed, begins the 
process of gathering and encrypting 
corporate data. 
• The goal of the attackers is financial gain, 
because they hold the company’s data for 
ransom until they are paid.

13

The Danger
Targeted Nations
• Some of today’s malware is so sophisticated 
and expensive to create that security 
experts believe only a nation state or group 
of nations could possibly have the influence 
and funding to create it.
• Such malware can be targeted to attack a 
nation’s vulnerable infrastructure, such as 
the water system or power grid.
• One such malware was the Stuxnet worm 
that infected USB drives and infiltrated 
Windows operating systems. It then 
targeted Step 7 software that was 
developed by Siemens for their 
Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).

18
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Threat Actors 
Threat Actors
• Threat actors are individuals or groups of individuals who perform 
cyberattacks. They include, but are not limited to:
• Amateurs
• Hacktivists
• Organized crime groups
• State-sponsored groups
• Terrorist groups
• Cyberattacks are intentional malicious acts meant to negatively 
impact another individual or organization.

19
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Threat Actors 
Threat Actors (Contd.)
Amateurs
• They are also known 
as script kiddies and 
have little or no skill.
• They often use 
existing tools or 
instructions found on 
the internet to launch 
attacks.
• Even though they 
use basic tools, the 
results can still be 
devastating.
Hacktivists
•
These are hackers who 
publicly protest against 
a variety of political and 
social ideas.
•
They post articles and 
videos, leaking 
sensitive information, 
and disrupting web 
services with 
illegitimate traffic in 
Distributed Denial of 
Service (DDoS) 
attacks.
Financial Gain
• Much of the hacking 
activity that 
consistently threatens 
our security is 
motivated by financial 
gain. 
•
Cybercriminals want to 
gain access to bank 
accounts, personal 
data, and anything else 
they can leverage to 
generate cash flow.
Trade Secrets and 
Global Politics
•
At times, nation states 
hack other countries, or 
interfere with their 
internal politics. 
•
Often, they may be 
interested in using 
cyberspace for 
industrial espionage. 
•
The theft of intellectual 
property can give a 
country a significant 
advantage in 
international trade.

20

Threat Actors 
How Secure is the Internet of Things?
• The Internet of Things (IoT) helps individuals 
connect things to improve their quality of life.
• Many devices on the internet are not updated with 
the latest firmware. Some older devices were not 
even developed to be updated with patches. These 
two situations create opportunity for threat actors 
and security risks for the owners of these devices.

1.3 Threat Impact 

23
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Threat Impact
PII, PHI, and PSI
• Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is any information 
that can be used to positively identify an individual, for example, 
name, social security number, birthdate, credit card numbers etc.
• Cybercriminals aim to obtain these lists of PII that can then be 
sold on the dark web. Stolen PII can be used to create fake 
financial accounts, such as credit cards and short-term loans. 
• The medical community creates and maintains Electronic 
Medical Records (EMRs) that contain Protected Health 
Information (PHI), a subset of PII.
• Personal Security Information (PSI), another type of PII, includes 
usernames, passwords, and other security-related information 
that individuals use to access information or services on the 
network.

24
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Threat Impact
Lost Competitive Advantage
• The loss of intellectual property to competitors is a serious concern. 
• An additional major concern is the loss of trust that comes when a company is unable 
to protect its customers’ personal data. 
• The loss of competitive advantage may come from this loss of trust rather than 
another company or country stealing trade secrets.

25
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Threat Impact
Politics and National Security
• It is not just businesses that get hacked.
• State-supported hacker warriors can cause disruption and destruction of vital services 
and resources within an enemy nation.
• The internet has become essential as a medium for commercial and financial 
activities. Disruption of these activities can devastate a nation’s economy.

Fighters in the War Against Cybercrime
Elements of a SOC
• To use a formalized, structured, and disciplined 
approach for defending against cyber threats, 
organizations typically use the services of 
professionals from a Security Operations Center 
(SOC). 
• SOCs provide a broad range of services, from 
monitoring and management, to comprehensive 
threat solutions and customized hosted security.
• SOCs can be wholly in-house, owned and operated 
by a business, or elements of a SOC can be 
contracted out to security vendors, such as 
Cisco’s Managed Security Services.

12

Fighters in the War Against Cybercrime
People in the SOC
SOCs assign job roles by tiers, according to the expertise and responsibilities required for each. 
Tiers
Responsibilities
Tier 1 Alert Analyst
Monitor incoming alerts, verify that a true incident has occurred, and 
forward tickets to Tier 2, if necessary.
Tier 2 Incident Responder
Responsible for deep investigation of incidents and advise remediation or 
action to be taken.
Tier 3 Threat Hunter
Experts in network, endpoint, threat intelligence, malware reverse 
engineering and tracing the processes of the malware to determine its 
impact and how it can be removed. They are also deeply involved in 
hunting for potential threats and implementing threat detection tools. Threat 
hunters search for cyber threats that are present in the network but have 
not yet been detected.
SOC Manager
Manages all the resources of the SOC and serves as the point of contact 
for the larger organization or customer.

People in the SOC (Contd.)
• First tier jobs are more entry 
level, while third tier jobs require 
extensive expertise.
• The figure, which is originally 
from the SANS Institute, 
graphically represents how 
these roles interact with each 
other.

Fighters in the War Against Cybercrime
Process in the SOC
• A Cybersecurity Analyst is required to monitor security alert 
queues and investigate the assigned alerts. A ticketing system 
is used to assign these alerts to the analyst’s queue. 
• The software that generates the alerts can trigger false 
alarms. The analyst, therefore, needs to verify that an 
assigned alert represents a true security incident. 
• When this verification is established, the incident can be 
forwarded to investigators or other security personnel to be 
acted upon. Otherwise, the alert is dismissed as a false alarm.
• If a ticket cannot be resolved, the Cybersecurity Analyst 
forwards the ticket to a Tier 2 Incident Responder for deeper 
investigation and remediation. 
• If the Incident Responder cannot resolve the ticket, it is 
forwarded it to a Tier 3 personnel.

Fighters in the War Against Cybercrime 
Technologies in the SOC: SIEM
• An SOC needs a Security 
Information and Event 
Management (SIEM) system to 
understand the data that firewalls, 
network appliances, intrusion 
detection systems, and other 
devices generate.
• SIEM systems collect and filter 
data, and detect, classify, analyze 
and investigate threats. They may 
also manage resources to 
implement preventive measures 
and address future threats.

Fighters in the War Against Cybercrime
Technologies in the SOC: SOAR
• SIEM and Security Orchestration, 
Automation and Response (SOAR) are 
often paired together as they have 
capabilities that complement each other.
• Large security operations (SecOps) 
teams use both technologies to optimize 
their SOC. 
• SOAR platforms are similar to SIEMs as 
they aggregate, correlate, and analyze 
alerts. In addition, SOAR technology 
integrate threat intelligence and 
automate incident investigation and 
response workflows based on playbooks 
developed by the security team.

17

Fighters in the War Against Cybercrime
Technologies in the SOC: SOAR (Contd.)
• SOAR security platforms:
• Gather alarm data from each component of the system.
• Provide tools that enable cases to be researched, assessed, and investigated.
• Emphasize integration as a means of automating complex incident response workflows 
that enable more rapid response and adaptive defense strategies.
• Include pre-defined playbooks that enable automatic response to specific threats. 
Playbooks can be initiated automatically based on predefined rules or may be triggered 
by security personnel.

SOC Metrics
• Whether internal to an organization or providing services to multiple organizations, it is important to 
understand how well the SOC is functioning, so that improvements can be made to the people, processes, 
and technologies that comprise the SOC.
• Many metrics or Key Performance Indicators (KPI) can be devised to measure different aspects of SOC 
performance. However, five metrics are commonly used as SOC metrics by SOC managers.
Metrics
Definition
Dwell Time
The length of time that threat actors have access to a network before they are 
detected, and their access is stopped
Mean Time to 
Detect (MTTD)
The average time that it takes for the SOC personnel to identify valid security 
incidents have occurred in the network
Mean Time to 
Respond (MTTR) 
The average time it takes to stop and remediate a security incident
Mean Time to 
Contain (MTTC) 
The time required to stop the incident from causing further damage to systems or data
Time to Control
The time required to stop the spread of malware in the network

Enterprise and Managed Security
• For medium and large networks, the organization will benefit from implementing an 
enterprise-level SOC, which is a complete in-house solution. 
• Larger organizations may outsource at least a part of the SOC operations to a security 
solutions provider.
• Cisco offers a wide range of incident response, preparedness, and management capabilities 
including:
•
Cisco Smart Net Total Care Service for Rapid Problem Resolution
•
Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT)
•
Cisco Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)
•
Cisco Managed Services
•
Cisco Tactical Operations (TacOps)
•
Cisco’s Safety and Physical Security Program

Security vs. Availability
• Security personnel understand that for the organization to accomplish its priorities, network 
availability must be preserved.
• Each business or industry has a limited tolerance for network downtime. That tolerance is 
usually based upon a comparison of the cost of the downtime in relation to the cost of 
ensuring against downtime.
• Security cannot be so strong that it interferes with the needs of employees or business 
functions. It is always a tradeoff between strong security and permitting efficient business 
functioning.

Getting Experience
• Internships: Internships are an excellent method for entering the 
cybersecurity field. Sometimes, internships turn into an offer of full time 
employment. However, even a temporary internship allows you the 
opportunity to gain experience in the inner workings of a cybersecurity 
organization
• Scholarships and Awards: To help close the security
skills gap, organizations like Cisco and INFOSEC have
introduced scholarship and awards programs.
• Temporary Agencies: Many organizations use temporary agencies to fill 
job openings for the first 90 days. If the employee is a good match, the 
organization may convert the employee to a full-time, permanent 
position.
• Your First Job: If you have no experience in the cybersecurity field, 
working for a call center or support desk may be your first step into 
gaining the experience you need to move ahead in your career.

The Windows Operating System
Disk Operating System
• The Disk Operating System (DOS) is an 
operating system that the computer uses to 
enable the data storage devices to read and write 
files.
• DOS provides a file system which organizes the 
files in a specific way on the disk.
• MS-DOS, created by Microsoft, used a command 
line as the interface for people to create programs 
and manipulate data files. DOS commands are 
shown in bold text in the given command output.
• With MS-DOS, the computer had a basic working 
knowledge of accessing the disk drive and 
loading the operating system files directly from 
disk as part of the boot process. 

13
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
The Windows Operating System
Disk Operating System (Contd.)
• Early versions of Windows consisted of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that ran over MS-
DOS, starting with Windows 1.0 in 1985.
• In newer versions of Windows, built on New Technologies (NT), the operating system itself is 
in direct control of the computer and its hardware. 
• Today, many things that used to be accomplished through the command line interface of MS-
DOS can be accomplished in the Windows GUI.
• To experience a little of MS-DOS, open a command window by typing cmd in Windows 
Search and pressing Enter.

The Windows Operating System
Windows Versions
• Since 1993, there have been more than 20 releases of Windows that are based on the NT 
operating system (OS).
• Many editions were built specifically for workstation, professional, server, advanced server, 
and datacenter server, to name just a few of the many purpose-built versions.
• The 64-bit operating system was an entirely new architecture. It had a 64-bit address space 
instead of a 32-bit address space.
• 64-bit computers and operating systems are backward-compatible with older, 32-bit 
programs, but 64-bit programs cannot be run on older, 32-bit hardware.
• With each subsequent release of Windows, the operating system has become more refined 
by incorporating more features.
• Microsoft has announced that Windows 10 is the last version of Windows. Rather than 
purchasing new operating systems, users will just update Windows 10 instead.

The Windows Operating System
Windows GUI
• Windows has a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to work with data files and software. 
• The GUI has a main area that is 
known as the Desktop. The Desktop 
can be customized with various colors 
and background images. 
• Windows supports multiple users, so 
each user can customize the Desktop. 
• The Desktop can store files, folders, 
shortcuts to locations and programs, 
and applications.
• The Desktop also has a recycle bin 
icon, where files are stored when the 
user deletes them. Files can be 
restored from the recycle bin or the 
recycle bin can be emptied of files, 
which truly deletes them.

Operating System Vulnerabilities
• Operating systems consist of millions of lines of code. With all this code comes vulnerabilities.
• A vulnerability is some flaw or weakness that can be exploited by an attacker to reduce the 
viability of a computer’s information.
• To take advantage of an operating system vulnerability, the attacker must use a technique or 
a tool to exploit the vulnerability.
• The attacker can then use the vulnerability to get the computer to act in a fashion outside of 
its intended design. 
• In general, the goal is to gain unauthorized control of the computer, change permissions, or to 
manipulate or steal data.

The following table lists some common Windows OS Security recommendations:
Recommendation
Description
Virus or malware 
protection
• By default, Windows uses Windows Defender for malware protection.
• Windows Defender provides a suite of protection tools built into the system.
• If Windows Defender is turned off, the system becomes more vulnerable to attacks 
and malware.
Unknown or 
unmanaged 
services
• There are many services that run behind the scenes.
• It is important to make sure that each service is identifiable and safe.
• With an unknown service running in the background, the computer can be 
vulnerable to attack.
Encryption
• When data is not encrypted, it can easily be gathered and exploited.
• This is not only important for desktop computers, but especially mobile devices.
Security policy
• A good security policy must be configured and followed.
• Many settings in the Windows Security Policy control can prevent attacks.

Operating System Vulnerabilities (Contd.)
Recommendation
Description
Firewall
• By default, Windows uses Windows Firewall to limit communication with devices on 
the network. Over time, rules may no longer apply.
• It is important to review firewall settings periodically to ensure that the rules are still 
applicable and remove any that no longer apply.
File and share 
permissions
• These permissions must be set correctly. It is easy to give the “Everyone” group Full 
Control, but this allows all people to access all files.
• It is best to provide each user or group with the minimum necessary permissions for 
all files and folders.
Weak or no 
password
• Many people choose weak passwords or do not use a password at all.
• It is especially important to make sure that all accounts, especially the Administrator 
account, have a very strong password.
Login as 
Administrator
• When a user logs in as an administrator, any program that they run will have the 
privileges of that account.
• It is best to log in as a Standard User and only use the administrator password to 
accomplish certain tasks.

Hardware Abstraction Layer
• A hardware abstraction layer (HAL) is 
software that handles all of the 
communication between the hardware 
and the kernel.
• The kernel is the core of the operating 
system and has control over the entire 
computer.
• The kernel handles all of the input and 
output requests, memory, and all of the 
peripherals connected to the computer.
• The basic Windows architecture is 
shown in the figure.

User Mode and Kernel Mode
• The two different modes in which a 
CPU operates when the computer 
has Windows installed are the user 
mode and the kernel mode.
• Installed applications run in user 
mode, and operating system code 
runs in kernel mode.
• All of the code that runs in kernel 
mode uses the same address space.
• When user mode code runs, it is 
granted its own restricted address 
space by the kernel, along with a 
process created specifically for the 
application.

Windows File Systems
A file system is a way of organizing the information on storage media. The following table lists 
the file systems supported by Windows:
Windows File 
System
Description
exFAT
• This is a simple file system supported by many different operating systems.
• FAT has limitations to the number of partitions, partition sizes, and file sizes that it 
can address, so it is not usually used for hard drives or solid-state drives 
anymore.
• Both FAT16 and FAT32 are available to use, with FAT32 being the most common 
as it has many fewer restrictions than FAT16.
Hierarchical File 
System Plus (HFS+)
• This file system is used on MAC OS X computers and allows much longer 
filenames, file sizes, and partition sizes.
• Although it is not supported by Windows without special software, Windows is 
able to read data from HFS+ partitions.

Windows File Systems (Contd.)
Windows File 
System
Description
Extended File 
System (EXT)
• This file system is used with Linux-based computers.
• Although it is not supported by Windows, Windows is able to read data from 
EXT partitions with special software.
New Technology File 
System (NTFS)
• This is the most commonly used file system when installing Windows. All 
versions of Windows and Linux support NTFS.
• Mac-OS X computers can only read an NTFS partition. They are able to write to 
an NTFS partition after installing special drivers.

Windows Architecture and Operations
Windows File Systems (Contd.)
NTFS formatting creates important structures on the disk for file storage, and tables for 
recording the locations of files:
•
Partition Boot Sector: This is the first 16 sectors of the drive. It contains the location of 
the Master File Table (MFT). The last 16 sectors contain a copy of the boot sector.
•
Master File Table (MFT): This table contains the locations of all the files and directories on 
the partition, including file attributes such as security information and timestamps.
•
System Files: These are hidden files that store information about other volumes and file 
attributes.
•
File Area: The main area of the partition where files and directories are stored. 
Note: When formatting a partition, the previous data may still be recoverable because not all the 
data is completely removed. It is recommended to perform a secure wipe on a drive that is being 
reused. The secure wipe will write data to the entire drive multiple times to ensure there is no 
remaining data.

Windows Architecture and Operations
Alternate Data Streams
• NTFS stores files as a series of attributes, such 
as the name of the file, or a timestamp.
• The data which the file contains is stored in the 
attribute $DATA, and is known as a data 
stream.
• By using NTFS, Alternate Data Streams (ADSs) 
can be connected to the file.
• An attacker could store malicious code within an 
ADS that can then be called from a  different 
file.
• In the NTFS file system, a file with an ADS is 
identified after the filename and a colon, for 
example, Testfile.txt:ADS. This filename 
indicates an ADS called ADS is associated with 
the file called Testfile.txt.

Windows Boot Process
• Many actions occur between the power button 
is pressed and Windows is fully loaded. This is 
the Windows Boot process. Two types of 
computer firmware exist:
• Basic Input-Output System (BIOS): The 
process begins with the BIOS initialization 
phase in which the hardware devices are 
initialized and a POST is performed. When 
the system disk is discovered, the POST 
ends and looks for the master boot record 
(MBR).The BIOS executes the MBR code 
and the operating system starts to load.
• Unified Extensible Firmware Interface 
(UEFI): UEFI firmware boots by loading EFI 
program files (.efi) stored in a special disk 
partition, known as the EFI System Partition 
(ESP).

31

Windows Architecture and Operations
Windows Boot Process (Contd.)
• Whether the firmware is BIOS or UEFI, after a valid Windows installation is located, 
the Bootmgr.exe file is run.
• Bootmgr.exe reads the Boot Configuration Database (BCD).
• If the computer is coming out of hibernation, the boot process continues with Winresume.exe.
• If the computer is being booted from a cold start, then the Winload.exe file is loaded.
• Winload.exe also uses Kernel Mode Code Signing (KMCS) to make sure that all drivers are 
digitally signed.
• After the drivers have been examined, Winload.exe runs Ntoskrnl.exe that starts the 
Windows kernel and sets up the HAL.
Note: A computer that uses UEFI stores boot code in the firmware. This helps to increase the 
security of the computer at boot time because the computer goes directly into protected mode.

Windows Startup
• There are two important registry items that are used to automatically start applications and 
services:
• HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE - Several aspects of Windows configuration are stored in this key, 
including information about services that start with each boot.
• HKEY_CURRENT_USER - Several aspects related to the logged in user are stored in this 
key, including information about services that start only when the user logs on to the 
computer.
• Different entries in these registry locations define which services and applications will start, as 
indicated by their entry type.
• These types include Run, RunOnce, RunServices, RunServicesOnce, and Userinit. These 
entries can be manually entered into the registry, but it is much safer to use 
the Msconfig.exe tool. 
• The Msconfig tool is used to view and change all of the start-up options for the computer. It 
opens the System Configuration window.

Windows Shutdown
• It is always best to perform a proper shutdown to turn off the computer. The computer needs 
time to close each application, shut down each service, and record any configuration 
changes before power is lost.
• During shutdown, the computer will close user mode applications first, followed by kernel 
mode processes.
• There are several ways to shut down a Windows computer: Start menu power options, the 
command line command shutdown, and using Ctrl+Alt+Delete and clicking the power icon. 
• There are three different options from which to choose when shutting down the computer:
• Shutdown: Turns the computer off (power off).
• Restart: Re-boots the computer (power off and power on).
• Hibernate: Records the current state of the computer and user environment and stores it 
in a file. Hibernation allows the user to pick up right where they left off very quickly with all 
their files and programs still open.

Windows Architecture and Operations
Processes, Threads, and Services
• A Windows application is made up of 
processes. A process is any program that is 
currently executing.
• Each process that runs is made up of at least 
one thread. A thread is a part of the process that 
can be executed.
• To configure Windows processes, search for 
Task Manager. The Processes tab of the Task  
Manager is shown in the figure.
• All of the threads dedicated to a process are 
contained within the same address space which 
means that these threads may not access the 
address space of any other process. This 
prevents corruption of other processes.

40
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Windows Architecture and Operations
Processes, Threads, and Services (Contd.)
• Some of the processes that Windows 
runs are services. These are programs 
that run in the background to support the 
operating system and applications.
• Services provide long-running 
functionality, such as wireless or access 
to an FTP server.
• To configure Windows Services, search 
for services. The Windows Services 
control panel applet is shown in the 
figure.
• Be very careful when manipulating the 
settings of these services. Shutting down 
a service may adversely affect 
applications or other services.

Windows Architecture and Operations
Memory Allocation and Handles
• The virtual address space for a process is the set of virtual addresses that the process
can use. 
• The virtual address is not the actual physical location in memory, but an entry in a page table 
that is used to translate the virtual address into the physical address.
• Each process in a 32-bit Windows computer supports a virtual address space that enables 
addressing up to 4 gigabytes.
• Each process in a 64-bit Windows computer supports a virtual address space of 8 terabytes.
• Each user space process runs in a private address space, separate from other user space 
processes.
• When the user space process needs to access kernel resources, it must use a process handle. 
• As the user space process is not allowed to directly access these kernel resources, the 
process handle provides the access needed by the user space process without a direct 
connection to it.

42

Windows Architecture and Operations
Memory Allocation and Handles (Contd.)
• A powerful tool for viewing 
memory allocation is RAMMap, 
which is shown in the figure.
• RAMMap is part of the 
Windows Sysinternals Suite of 
tools. It can be downloaded 
from Microsoft. 
• RAMMap provides information 
regarding how Windows has 
allocated system memory to 
the kernel, processes, drivers, 
and applications.

The Windows Registry
• Windows stores all of the information about hardware, applications, users, and system 
settings in a large database known as the registry.
• The registry is a hierarchical database where the highest level is known as a hive, below that 
there are keys, followed by subkeys.
• Values store data and are stored in the keys and subkeys. A registry key can be up to 512 
levels deep.
• The following table lists the five hives of the Windows registry:
Registry Hive
Description
HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU)
Holds information concerning the currently logged in user.
HKEY_USERS (HKU)
Holds information concerning all the user accounts on the host.
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT (HKCR)
Holds information about object linking and embedding (OLE) 
registrations. It allows users to embed objects from other applications 
into a single document.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM)
Holds system-related information.
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG (HKCC) Holds information about the current hardware profile.

The Windows Registry (Contd.)
• New hives cannot be created. The 
registry keys and values in the hives 
can be created, modified, or deleted 
by an account with administrative 
privileges. 
• As shown in the figure, the 
tool regedit.exe is used to modify 
the registry. 
• Be very careful when using this tool. 
Minor changes to the registry can 
have massive or even catastrophic 
effects.

• Use the left panel to navigate the hives and the structure below it and use the right panel to 
see the contents of the highlighted item in the left panel.
• The path is displayed at the bottom of the window for reference.
• Registry keys can contain either a subkey or a value. The different values that keys can 
contain are as follows:
• REG_BINARY: Numbers or Boolean values
• REG_DWORD: Numbers greater than 32 bits or raw data
• REG_SZ: String values
• The registry also contains the activity that a user performs during normal day-to-day computer 
use.
• This includes the history of hardware devices, including all devices that have been connected 
to the computer including the name, manufacturer and serial number.

Run as Administrator
• As a security best practice, it is not advisable to log on to Windows using the Administrator 
account or an account with administrative privileges. 
• There are two different ways to run or install 
a software that requires the privileges of the 
Administrator.
Administrator
• Right-click the command in the Windows File

Local Users and Domains
• When a new computer is started for the first time, or Windows is installed, there will be a 
prompt to create a user account. This is known as a local user.
• This account contains all the customization settings, access permissions, file locations, and 
many other user-specific data.
• To make administration of users easier, Windows uses groups. A group will have a name 
and a specific set of permissions associated with it.
• When a user is placed into a group, the permissions of that group are given to that user. 
• A user can be placed into multiple groups to be provided with many different permissions. 
When the permissions overlap, certain permissions, like “explicitly deny” will override the 
permission provided by a different group. 
• There are many different user groups built into Windows that are used for specific tasks.

Local Users and Domains (Contd.)
• Local users and groups are 
managed with the 
lusrmgr.msc control panel 
applet, as shown in the figure.
• Windows also use domains to 
set permissions. A domain is a 
type of network service where 
all of the users, groups, 
computers, peripherals, and 
security settings are stored on 
and controlled by a database.

CLI and PowerShell
• The Windows command line interface (CLI) can be used to run programs, navigate the file 
system, and manage files and folders.
• To open the Windows CLI, search for cmd.exe and click the program. These are a few things to 
remember when using the CLI:
• The file names and paths are not case-sensitive, by default.
• Storage devices are assigned a letter for reference. This followed by a colon and backslash (\). 
• Commands that have optional switches use the forward slash (/) to delineate between the 
command and the switch option.
• You can use the Tab key to auto-complete commands when directories or files are referenced.
• Windows keeps a history of the commands that were entered during a CLI session. Access 
previously entered commands by using the up and down arrow keys.
• To switch between storage devices, type the letter of the device, followed by a colon, and then 
press Enter.

CLI and PowerShell (Contd.)
• Another environment, called the Windows PowerShell, can be used to create scripts to 
automate tasks that the regular CLI is unable to create. 
• PowerShell also provides a CLI for initiating commands. 
• PowerShell is an integrated program within Windows. 
• Like the CLI, PowerShell can also be run with administrative privileges.
• These are the types of commands that PowerShell can execute:
• cmdlets - These commands perform an action and return an output or object to the next 
command that will be executed.
• PowerShell scripts - These are files with a .ps1 extension that contain PowerShell 
commands that are executed.
• PowerShell functions - These are pieces of code that can be referenced in a script.

Windows Configuration and Monitoring
Networking
• One of the most important features of any operating system is the ability for the computer to 
connect to a network.
• To configure Windows networking properties and test networking settings, the Network and 
Sharing Center is used.
Network and Sharing Center
•
It is used to verify or create network 
connections, configure network sharing, 
and change network adapter settings.
•
The initial view shows an overview of 
the active network. 
•
From the window, you can see the 
HomeGroup the computer belongs to, 
or create one if it is not already part of a 
HomeGroup. Note that HomeGroup
was removed from Windows 10 in 
version 1803.

Windows Configuration and Monitoring
Accessing Network Resources
• Windows uses networking for many different applications such as web, email, and file 
services.
• Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is used to share network resources. It is mostly used 
for accessing files on remote hosts. 
• The Universal Naming Convention (UNC) format is used to connect to resources such as 
\\servername\sharename\file.
• In the UNC, servername is the server that is hosting the resource. The sharename is the root 
of the folder in the file system on the remote host, while the file is the resource that the local 
host is trying to find. 
• When sharing resources on the network, the area of the file system that will be shared will 
need to be identified. Access control can be applied to the files to restrict users and groups to 
specific functions. 
• There are also special shares that are automatically created by Windows. These shares are 
called administrative shares and are identified by a dollar sign ($) that comes after the share 
name.

70
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Windows Configuration and Monitoring
Accessing Network Resources (Contd.)
• Besides accessing shares on remote hosts, 
the user can also log in to a remote host and 
manipulate that computer, as if it were local, 
to make configuration changes, install 
software, or troubleshoot an issue. 
• In Windows, this feature uses the Remote 
Desktop Protocol (RDP). The Remote 
Desktop Connection window is shown in the 
figure.
• Since Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is 
designed to permit remote users to control 
individual hosts, it is a natural target for threat 
actors.

Windows Server
• Most Windows installations are performed as desktop installations on desktops and laptops.
• There is another edition of Windows that is mainly used in data centers called Windows 
Server. This is a family of Microsoft products that began with Windows Server 2003.
• Windows Server hosts many different services and can fulfill different roles within a company.
• These are some of the services that Windows Server provides:
• Network Services: DNS, DHCP, Terminal services, Network Controller, and Hyper-V 
Network virtualization
• File Services: SMB, NFS, and DFS
• Web Services: FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS
• Management: Group policy and Active Directory domain services control
Note: Although there is a Windows Server 2000, it is considered a client version of Windows 
NT 5.0. Windows Server 2003 is a server based on NT 5.2 and begins a new family of 
Windows Server versions.

The netstat Command
• The netstat command is used to look for inbound or outbound connections that are not 
authorized.
• The netstat command will display all of the active TCP connections.
• By examining these connections, it is possible to determine the programs which are listening 
for connections that are not authorized. 
• When a program is suspected of being malware, the process can be shut down with Task 
Manager, and malware removal software can be used to clean the computer.
• To make this process easier, the connections can be linked to the running processes that 
were created by them in Task Manager.

78
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Windows Security 
The netstat Command (Contd.)
• To do this, open a command prompt with 
administrative privileges and enter 
the netstat -abno command.
• By examining the active TCP connections, 
an analyst should be able to determine if 
there are any suspicious programs that are 
listening for incoming connections on the 
host. 
• There may be more than one process 
listed with the same name. If this is the 
case, use the unique PID to find the correct 
process. To display the PIDs for the 
processes in the Task Manager, open 
the Task Manager, right-click the table 
heading and select PID.

• These log files are a 
troubleshooting tool as they 
provide information necessary to 
identify a problem.
• Windows includes two categories 
of event logs: Windows Logs and 
Application and Services Logs.
• A built-in custom view called 
Administrative Events shows all 
critical, error, and warning events 
from all the administrative logs.
• Security event logs are found 
under Windows Logs. They use 
event IDs to identify the type of 
event.

Windows Security 
Windows Update Management
• To ensure the highest level of 
protection against the attacks, 
always ensure Windows is up to 
date with the latest service 
packs and security patches.
• Update status, shown in the 
figure, allows you to check for 
updates manually and see the 
update history of the computer.
• Patches are code updates that 
manufacturers provide to 
prevent a newly discovered 
virus or worm from making a 
successful attack.

Windows Security 
Windows Update Management (Contd.)
• From time to time, manufacturers combine patches and upgrades into a comprehensive 
update application called a service pack.
• Many devastating virus attacks could have been much less severe if more users had 
downloaded and installed the latest service pack.
• It is highly desirable that enterprises utilize systems that automatically distribute, install, and 
track security updates.
• Windows routinely checks the Windows Update website for high-priority updates that can 
help protect a computer from the latest security threats.
• There are also settings for the hours where the computer will not automatically restart, for 
example during regular business hours.
• Advanced options are also available to choose how updates are installed how other Microsoft 
products are updated.

Windows Security 
Local Security Policy
• A security policy is a set of objectives 
that ensures the security of a 
network, the data, and the computer 
systems in an organization.
• In most networks that use Windows 
computers, Active Directory is 
configured with Domains on a 
Windows Server. Windows 
computers join the domain.
• Windows Local Security Policy can 
be used for stand-alone computers 
that are not part of an Active 
Directory domain.

83

Windows Security 
Local Security Policy (Contd.)
• Password guidelines are an important component of a security policy.
• In the Local Security Policy, Password Policy is found under Account Policies and defines the 
criteria for the passwords for all of the users on the local computer.
• Use the Account Lockout Policy in Account Policies to prevent brute-force login attempts.
• It is important to ensure that computers are secure when users are away. A security policy 
should contain a rule about requiring a computer to lock when the screensaver starts.
• If the Local Security Policy on every stand-alone computer is the same, then use the Export 
Policy feature. This is particularly helpful if the administrator needs to configure extensive 
local policies for user rights and security options.
• The Local Security Policy applet contains security settings that apply specifically to the local 
computer. The user can configure User Rights, Firewall Rules, and the ability to restrict the 
files that users or groups are allowed to run with the AppLocker.

are designed to invade privacy, steal information, damage the computer, or corrupt data.
• It is important to protect computers and mobile devices using reputable antimalware software. 
The following types of antimalware programs are available:
• Antivirus protection: This program continuously monitors for viruses. When a virus is 
detected, the user is warned, and the program attempts to quarantine or delete the virus.
• Adware protection: This program continuously looks for programs that display advertising 
on the computer.
• Phishing protection: This program blocks the IP addresses of known phishing websites 
and warns the user about suspicious sites.
• Spyware protection: This program scans for keyloggers and other spyware.

The Windows Operating System Summary 
What Did I Learn in this Module?
• The first computers required a Disk Operating System (DOS) to create and manage files.
• Microsoft developed MS-DOS as a command line interface (CLI) to access the disk drive and 
load the operating system files. Early versions of Windows consisted of a Graphical User 
Interface (GUI) that ran over MS-DOS.
• Windows consists of a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) which handles all the 
communication between the hardware and the kernel. 
• Windows operates in two different modes, the user mode and kernel mode. Most Windows 
programs run in user mode. The kernel mode allows operating system code direct access to the 
computer hardware.
• A computer works by storing instructions in RAM until the CPU processes them.
• Each process in a 32-bit Windows computer supports a virtual address space that enables 
addressing up to four gigabytes. Each process in a 64-bit Windows computer supports a 
virtual address space of up to eight terabytes.

89
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
The Windows Operating System Summary 
What Did I Learn in this Module? (Contd.)
• Windows stores all of the information about hardware, applications, users, and system 
settings in a large database known as the registry.
• The registry is a hierarchical database where the highest level is known as a hive, below that 
there are keys, followed by subkeys. 
• There are five registry hives that contain data regarding the configuration and operation of 
Windows. There are hundreds of keys and subkeys.
• For security reasons, it is not advisable to log on to Windows using the Administrator account 
or an account with administrative privileges.
• Use Windows groups to make administration of users easier. Local users and groups are 
managed with the lusrmgr.msc control panel applet.
• You can use the CLI or the Windows PowerShell to execute commands. PowerShell can be 
used to create scripts to automate tasks that the regular CLI is unable to automate.
• Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is used to manage remote computers.

The Windows Operating System Summary 
What Did I Learn in this Module? (Contd.)
• The net command can be combined with switches to focus on specific output.
• Task Manager provides a lot of information about what is running, and the general 
performance of the computer. The Resource Monitor provides more detailed information 
about resource usage.
• The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is used to share network resources such as files 
on remote hosts.
• The Windows netstat command displays all open communication ports on a computer and 
can also display the software processes that are associated with the ports.
• Windows Event Viewer provides access to numerous logged events regarding the operation 
of a computer. 
• It is very important to keep Windows up to date to guard against new security threats.
• Windows should be configured to automatically download and install updates as they become 
available.

Linux Overview
The Value of Linux
Linux is often the operating system of choice in the Security Operations Center (SOC). These 
are some of the reasons to choose Linux:
• Linux is open source - Any person can acquire Linux at no charge and modify it to fit 
specific needs. 
• The Linux CLI is very powerful - The Linux Command Line Interface (CLI) is extremely 
powerful and enables analysts to perform tasks not only directly on a terminal, but also 
remotely.
• The user has more control over the OS - The administrator user in Linux, known as the 
root user, or superuser, can modify any aspect of the computer with a few keystrokes. 
• It allows for better network communication control - Control is an inherent part of Linux.

•
This software is used to specify, based on pre-defined rules, whether 
traffic is allowed to enter or leave a network or device.
Log managers
•
Log files are used to record events.
•
Because a network can generate a very large number of log entries, log 
manager software is employed to facilitate log monitoring.
Security information and 
event management (SIEM)
•
SIEMs provide real-time analysis of alerts and log entries generated by 
network appliances such as IDSs and firewalls.
Ticketing systems
•
Task ticket assignment, editing, and recording is done through a ticket 
management system. Security alerts are often assigned to analysts 
through a ticketing system.

Linux Overview
Linux Tools
• Linux computers that are used in the SOC 
often contain penetration testing tools. 
• A penetration test, also known as PenTesting, 
is the process of looking for vulnerabilities in 
a network or computer by attacking it. 
• Packet generators, port scanners, and proof-
of-concept exploits are examples of 
PenTesting tools.
• Kali Linux is a Linux distribution which 
contains many penetration tools together in a 
single Linux distribution.

Working in the Linux Shell 
The Linux Shell
• In Linux, the user communicates with the OS by using the CLI or the GUI.
• Linux often starts in the GUI by default. This hides the CLI from the user. 
• One way to access the CLI from the GUI is through a terminal emulator application. These 
applications provide user access to the CLI and are named as some variation of the word 
terminal.
• In Linux, popular terminal emulators are Terminator, eterm, xterm, konsole, and gnome-
terminal.
• Fabrice Bellard has created JSLinux which allows an emulated version of Linux to run in a 
browser.
Note: The terms shell, console, console window, CLI terminal, and terminal window are 
often used interchangeably.

Working in the Linux Shell 
Working with Text Files
• Linux has many different text editors, with various features and functions.
• Some text editors include graphical interfaces while others are command-line only tools. 
Each text editor includes a feature set designed to support a specific type of task.
• Some text editors focus on the programmer and include features such as syntax highlighting, 
parenthesis check, and other programming-focused features.
• While graphical text editors are convenient and easy to use, command line-based text 
editors are very important for Linux users. The main benefit of command-line-based text 
editors is that they allow for text file editing from a remote computer.

Working in the Linux Shell 
The Importance of Text Files in Linux
• In Linux, everything is treated as a file. This includes the memory, the disks, the monitor, and 
the directories.
• Configuration files are text files which are used to store adjustments and settings for specific 
applications or services.
• Users with proper permission levels can use text editors to change the contents of 
configuration files.
• After the changes are made, the file is saved and can be used by the related service or 
application. Users are able to specify exactly how they want any given application or service 
to behave. When launched, services and applications check the contents of specific 
configuration files to adjust their behavior accordingly.
Note: The administrator used the command sudo nano /etc/hosts to open the file. The 
command sudo (short for “superuser do”) invokes the superuser privilege to use the nano 
text editor to open the host file.

Working in the Linux Shell 
The Importance of Text Files in Linux (Contd.)
• In the figure, the administrator 
opened the host configuration 
file in nano for editing. 
• The host file contains static 
mappings of host IP addresses 
to names. 
• The names serve as shortcuts 
that allow connecting to other 
devices by using a name instead 
of an IP address. Only the 
superuser can change the host 
file.

Linux Servers and Clients 
An Introduction to Client-Server Communications
• Servers are computers with software 
installed that enables them to provide 
services to clients across the network.
• Some provide external resources such 
as files, email messages, or web pages 
to clients upon request. 
• Other services run maintenance tasks 
such as log management, disk scanning 
and so on.
• Each service requires separate server 
software. 
• The server in the figure uses file server 
software to provide clients with the ability 
to retrieve and submit files.

Servers, Services, and Their Ports
• A port is a reserved network resource used by a service.
• While the administrator can decide which port to use with any given service, many clients are 
configured to use a specific port by default.
• The following table lists a few commonly used ports and their services. These are also called 
as well-known ports.

• Clients are programs or applications 
designed to communicate with a 
specific type of server.
• Clients use a well-defined protocol to 
communicate with the server.
• Web browsers are web clients that are 
used to communicate with web servers 
through the Hyper Text Transfer 
Protocol on port 80. 
• The File Transfer Protocol client is 
software used to communicate with an

Basic Server Administration
Service Configuration Files
• In Linux, services are managed using 
configuration files. 
• Common options in configuration files are 
port number, location of the hosted 
resources, and client authorization details.
• When the service starts, it looks for its 
configuration files, loads them into 
memory, and adjusts itself according to the 
settings in the files.
• The command output shows a portion of 
the configuration file for Nginx, which is a 
lightweight web server for Linux.

Hardening Devices
• Device hardening involves implementing proven methods of securing the device and 
protecting its administrative access. 
• Some of these methods involve maintaining passwords, configuring enhanced remote login 
features, and implementing secure login with SSH.
• Depending on the Linux distribution, many services are enabled by default. Stopping such 
services and ensuring they do not automatically start at boot time is another device hardening 
technique.
• OS updates are extremely important to maintaining a hardened device. OS developers create 
and issue fixes and patches regularly.

Monitoring Service Logs
• Log files are the records that a computer stores to keep track of important events. Kernel, 
services, and application events are all recorded in log files.
• By monitoring Linux log files, an administrator gains a clear picture of the computer’s 
performance, security status, and any underlying issues.
• In Linux, log files can be categorized as:
• Application logs
• Event logs
• Service logs
• System logs
• Some logs contain information about daemons that are running in Linux. A daemon is a 
background process that runs without the need for user interaction.

Linux Log File
Description
/var/log/dmesg
•
This directory contains kernel ring buffer messages.
•
Information related to hardware devices and their drivers is recorded here.
•
It is very important because, due to their low-level nature, logging systems 
such as syslog are not running when these events take place and are 
unavailable to the administrator in real-time.
/var/log/kern.log
•
This file contains information logged by the kernel.
/var/log/cron
•
Cron is a service used to schedule automated tasks in Linux and this

The Linux File System 
The File System Types in Linux
• There are many different kinds of file systems, varying in properties of speed, flexibility, 
security, size, structure, logic and more. 
• The administrator decides the file system type which is suitable for the operating system.
• The following table lists a few file system types commonly found and supported by Linux.
Linux File System
Description
ext2 (second extended 
file system)
•
ext2 was the default file system in several major Linux distributions until 
supplanted by ext3.
•
ext2 is still the file system of choice for flash-based storage media, as its 
lack of a journal, increases performance and minimizes the number of 
writes.
•
As flash memory devices have a limited number of write operations, 
minimizing write operations increases the device’s lifetime.

Linux File System
Description
ext3 (third extended file 
system)
•
ext3 is a journaled file system designed to improve the existing ext2 file 
system.
•
A journal or log, the main feature added to ext3, is a technique used to 
minimize the risk of file system corruption in the event of sudden power loss.
•
The file systems keeps a log of all the changes to be made.
•
If the computer crashes before the change is complete, the journal can be 
used to restore or correct any issues created by the crash.
•
The maximum file size in ext3 file systems is 32 TB.
ext4 (fourth extended file 
system)
•
ext4 was created based on a series of extensions to ext3.
•
While the extensions improve the performance of ext3 and increase 
supported file sizes, developers were concerned about stability issues and 
were opposed to adding the extensions to the stable ext3.
•
The ext3 project was split in two; one kept as ext3 and its normal 
development and the other, named ext4, incorporated the mentioned 
extensions.

Linux File System
Description
NFS (Network File 
System)
•
NFS is a network-based file system, allowing file access over the network.
•
From the user standpoint, there is no difference between accessing a file 
stored locally or on another computer on the network.
•
NFS is an open standard which allows anyone to implement it.
CDFS (Compact 
Disc File System)
•
CDFS was created specifically for optical disk media.
Swap File System
•
The swap file system is used by Linux when it runs out of RAM.
•
When this happens, the kernel moves inactive RAM content to the swap 
partition on the disk.
•
While swap partitions can be useful to Linux computers with a limited amount 
of memory, they should not be considered as a primary solution.
•
Swap partition is stored on disk which has much lower access speeds than 
RAM.

Linux Roles and File Permissions
• Linux uses file permissions in order to organize the system and enforce boundaries within the 
computer.
• Every file in Linux carries its file permissions, which define the actions that the owner, the 
group, and others can perform with the file. 
• The possible permission rights are Read, Write, and Execute.
• The ls command with the -l parameter lists additional information about the file.

Linux Roles and File Permissions (Contd.)
The output of the ls -l command provides a lot of information about the file space.txt:
• The first field displays the permissions 
with space.txt (-rwxrw-r--). 
• The second field defines the number of hard 
links to the file (number 1 after the permissions). 
• The third and fourth field display the user 
(analyst) and group (staff) who own the file, 
respectively.
• The fifth field displays the file size in bytes. 
The space.txt file has 253 bytes.
• The sixth field displays the date and time of the 
last modification.
• The seventh field displays the file name.

Linux Roles and File Permissions (Contd.)
The figure here shows a breakdown of file permissions in Linux. The file space.txt has the 
following permissions:
• The dash (-) means that this is a file. 
• The first set of characters (rwx) is for 
user permission. The user (analyst) who 
owns the file can Read, Write and 
eXecute the file.
• The second set of characters is for group 
permissions (rw-). The group (staff) who 
owns the file can Read and Write to the 
file.
• The third set of characters is for any 
other user or group permissions (r--) 
who can only Read the file.

The Linux File System 
Hard Links and Symbolic Links
• A hard link is another file that points to the 
same location as the original file. 
• Use the command ln to create a hard link.
• The first argument is the existing file and the 
second argument is the new file. 
• As shown in the command output, the 
file space.txt is linked to space.hard.txt and 
the link field now shows 2.
• Both files point to the same location in the 
file system. If you change one file, the other 
is changed, as well.
• The echo command is used to add some 
text to space.txt.

59

The Linux File System 
Hard Links and Symbolic Links (Contd.)
• A symbolic link, also called a symlink
or soft link, is similar to a  hard link in 
that applying changes  to the symbolic 
link will also change the original file.
• As shown in the command output, use 
the ln command option -s to create a 
symbolic link.
• Notice that adding a line of text 
to test.txt also adds the line 
to mytest.txt.

The Linux File System 
Hard Links and Symbolic Links (Contd.)
The following table shows several benefits of symbolic links over hard links:
Hard Links
Soft Links
Locating hard links is difficult.
Symbolic links show the location of the original 
file in the ls -l command.
Hard links are limited to the file system in which 
they are created.
Symbolic links can link to a file in another file 
system.
Hard links cannot link to a directory as the 
system itself uses hard links to define the 
hierarchy of the directory structure.
Symbolic links can link to directories.

X Window System
• The graphical interface present in most Linux computers is based on the X Window System. 
• X Window, also known as X or X11, is a windowing system designed to provide the basic 
framework for a GUI.
• X includes functions for drawing and moving windows on the display device and interacting 
with a mouse and keyboard.
• X works as a server, which allows a remote user to use the network to connect, start a 
graphical application, and have the graphical window open on the remote terminal.
• X does not specify the user interface, leaving it to other programs, such as window 
managers, to define all the graphical components.

Processes and Forks
• A process is a running instance of a computer program.
• Forking is a method that the kernel uses to allow a process to create a copy of itself.
• Processes need a way to create new processes in multitasking operating systems. The fork 
operation is the only way of doing so in Linux.
• When a process calls a fork, the caller process becomes the parent process and the newly 
created process becomes its child. 
• After the fork, the processes are, to some extent, independent processes. They have 
different process IDs but run the same program code.

Processes and Forks (Contd.)
The following table lists three commands that are used to manage processes.
Command
Description
ps
•
Used to list the processes running on the computer at the time it is invoked.
•
It can be instructed to display running processes that belong to the current user or other 
users.
top
•
Used to list running processes, but unlike ps, top keeps displaying running processes 
dynamically.
•
Press q to exit top.
kill
•
Used to modify the behavior of a specific process.
•
Depending on the parameters, kill will remove, restart, or pause a process.
•
In many cases, the user will run ps or top before running kill.
•
This is done so the user can learn the PID of a process before running kill.

Malware on a Linux Host
• Linux malware includes viruses, Trojan horses, 
worms, and other types of malware that can 
affect the operating system.
• A common Linux attack vector is its services 
and processes.
• The command output shows an attacker using 
the Telnet command to probe the nature and 
version of a web server (port 80).
• The attacker has learned that the server is 
running nginx version 1.12.0. The next step 
would be to research known vulnerabilities in the 
nginx 1.12.0 code.

Rootkit Check
• A rootkit is a type of malware designed to increase an 
unauthorized user’s privileges or grant access to portions 
of the software that should not normally be allowed.
• A rootkit is destructive as it changes kernel code and its 
modules, changing the most fundamental operations of 
the OS itself.
• Rootkit detection methods include booting the computer  
from a trusted media.
• Rootkit removal can be complicated. Re-installation of the 
operating system is the only real solution to the problem.
• chkrootkit is a popular Linux-based program designed to 
check the computer for known rootkits.
• The command output shows the output of chkrootkit on 
an Ubuntu Linux.

Piping Commands
• Although command line tools are usually 
designed to perform a specific, well-defined task, 
many commands can be combined to perform 
more complex tasks by a technique known as 
piping.
• Piping consists of chaining commands together, 
feeding the output of one command into the input 
of another.
• The two commands, ls and grep, can be piped 
together to filter out the output of ls. This is 
shown in the output of the ls -l | grep 
host command and the ls -l | grep file command.

• Linux is a fast, reliable, and small open-source operating system.
• In Linux, the user communicates with the operating system through a GUI or a command-line 
interface (CLI), or shell.
• Servers are computers that have software installed that enables them to provide services to 
client computers across the network.
• In Linux, servers are managed by using configuration files. Various settings can be modified 
and saved in configuration files.
• Linux supports a number of different file systems that vary by speed, flexibility, security, size, 
structure, logic, and more. Some of the file systems that are supported by Linux are ext2, 
ext3, ext4, NFS, and CDFS.
• The X Windows, or X11, system is a basic software framework that includes functions for 
creating, controlling, and configuring a windows GUI in a point-and-click interface.
• To install applications on Linux hosts, programs called package managers are used. 
Packages are software applications and all of their supporting files.

Network Protocols
Networks of Many Sizes
• Networks vary in size. They range from simple networks consisting of two computers, to 
networks connecting millions of devices.
• Businesses and large organizations use networks to provide consolidation, storage, and 
access to information on network servers. Networks provide email, instant messaging, and 
collaboration among employees. Many organizations use their network’s connection to the 
internet to provide products and services to customers.
• Peer-to-peer network: In small businesses and homes, many computers function as both 
the servers and clients on the network. This type of network is called a peer-to-peer network.

Networks of Many Sizes (Contd.)
• Small Home networks: Small home networks 
connect a few computers to each other and to the 
internet.
• Small Office and Home Office (SOHO) 
networks: The SOHO network allows a home 
office or a remote office to connect to a corporate 
network, or access centralized, shared resources.
• Medium to Large networks: These are used by 
corporations and schools and can have many 
locations with hundreds or thousands of 
interconnected hosts.
• World Wide networks: The internet is a network 
of networks that connects hundreds of millions of 
computers world-wide.

Network Protocols
Client-Server Communications
• All computers that are connected to a network and that participate directly in network 
communication are classified as hosts. Hosts are also called end devices, endpoints, or 
nodes.
• Servers are simply computers with specialized software that enables servers to provide 
information to other end devices on the network. 
• A server can be single-purpose, providing only one service, such as web pages or it can be 
multipurpose, providing a variety of services such as web pages, email, and file transfers.
• Client computers have software installed that enables them to request and display the 
information obtained from the server. A single computer can run multiple types of client 
software.

Network Protocols
Client-Server Communications (Contd.)
• The File Server stores corporate and user files 
in a central location. The client devices access 
these files with client software such as 
Windows Explorer.
• The Web Server runs web server software and 
clients use their browser software, such as 
Windows Internet Explorer, to access web 
pages on the server.
• The Email Server runs email server software 
and clients use their mail client software, such 
as Microsoft Outlook, to access email on the 
server.

Network Protocols
Typical Sessions
A typical network user normally uses some type of computing device to establish many connections with 
network servers. Those servers could be located in the same room or around the world.
Let us see some examples.
At School
•
Students are encouraged to use devices such as laptops and tablets to 
access learning resources. 
•
Terry, connects to the school’s wi-fi network and searches for the required 
resources using a search engine. 
•
Her search is submitted wirelessly from her device to the school’s network. 
The search data is addressed so that it can find its way back to Terry. 
•
The search string of binary data is encoded into radio waves and is converted 
into electrical signals that travel on the school’s wired network to reach the  
school’s Internet Service Provider’s (ISP) network.
•
A combination of technologies take Terry’s search to the search engine 
website, where the request is processed by the Search Engine’s servers. 
•
The results are then encoded and addressed to her school and eventually to 
Terry’s device.

Typical Sessions (Contd.)
While Gaming
• Michelle uses a gaming console to play games against other players. Her 
network connects to an ISP using a router and a cable modem that allow 
her home network to connect to a cable TV network belonging to Michelle’s 
ISP.
§ The cable wires for Michelle’s neighborhood all connect to a central point 
on a telephone pole and then connect to a fiber-optic network that connects 
many neighborhoods served by Michelle’s ISP.
• When Michelle connects her gaming console to a company that hosts a 
popular online game, her actions in her game become data that is sent to 
the gamer network. Information that identifies Michelle, the game she is 
playing, and Michelle’s network location are added to the game data. The 
pieces of data that represent Michelle’s game play are sent at high speed 
to the game provider’s network. 
• The results are returned to Michelle in the form of graphics and sounds.

Typical Sessions (Contd.)
In Medical Consultations
§ Dr. Ismael Awad frequently needs to consult with other specialists on patient 
cases. His hospital has taken subscription to a special service called Cloud 
that allows medical data including patient x-rays to be stored at a central 
location that accessible over the internet. 
• When a patient has an X-ray taken, the image is digitized as data. The 
hospital uses network services that encrypt the image data and patient 
information. This encrypted data cannot be intercepted and read as it travels 
across the internet to the cloud service provider’s data centers. The data is 
addressed so that it can be routed to the cloud provider’s data center to 
reach the correct services that provide storage and retrieval of high-
resolution digital images.
• All of this interaction is digital and takes place using networked services that 
are provided by the medical cloud service.

Tracing the Path
• Cybersecurity analysts need to have a deep understanding of how networks 
operate. They must be able to determine the origin of traffic and its destination.
• Traffic from a computer to an internet server can take many paths. 

19
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Network Protocols
Tracing the Path (Contd.)
• A combination of copper and fiber-optic 
cables that go over land and under the 
ocean carry data traffic. These 
connections connect 
telecommunications facilities and ISPs 
distributed throughout the world. 
• Global Tier 1 and Tier 2 ISPs connect 
portions of the internet together, usually 
through an Internet Exchange Point 
(IXP). 
• Larger networks connect to Tier 2 
networks through a Point of Presence 
(PoP), which is usually a location in the 
building where physical connections to 
the ISP are made. The Tier 3 ISPs 
connect homes and businesses to the 
internet.

Communications Protocols
What are Protocols?
• Simply having a connection between end 
devices is not enough to enable 
communication. For communication to 
occur, devices must know “how” to 
communicate. 
• Communication is governed by rules called 
protocols. 
• These protocols are specific to the type of 
communication method occurring.
• Network protocols specify many features of 
network communication.

23
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Communications Protocols
Network Protocols
• Network protocols provide the means for computers to communicate on networks.
• Network protocols dictate the message encoding, formatting, encapsulation, size, timing, 
and delivery options.
• Networking protocols define a common format and set of rules for exchanging messages 
between devices.
• Some common networking protocols are Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Transmission 
Control Protocol (TCP), and Internet Protocol (IP). 
Note: IP in this course refers to both the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. IPv6 is the most recent 
version of IP and will eventually replace the more common IPv4.

Message Structure specifies how the 
message is formatted or structured.
Path Sharing specifies the process by 
which networking devices share information 
about pathways with other networks.

Communications Protocols
The TCP/IP Protocol Suite
• TCP/IP is the protocol suite used by the 
internet and the networks of today.
• TCP/IP has two important aspects for 
vendors and manufacturers:
•
Open standard protocol suite - This 
means it is freely available to the public 
and can be used by any vendor on their 
hardware or in their software.
•
Standards-based protocol suite - This 
means it has been endorsed by the 
networking industry and approved by a 
standards organization.

Communications Protocols
The TCP/IP Protocol Suite (Contd.)
Network Access Layer
• Address Resolution - ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): Provides dynamic address 
mapping between an IPv4 address and a hardware address.
• Data Link Protocols -
• Ethernet: Defines the rules for wiring and signaling standards of the network access layer.
• WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network): Defines the rules for wireless signaling across the 
2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio frequencies.

34

Communications Protocols
Message Formatting and Encapsulation
• When a message is sent from source to destination, it must use a specific format 
or structure.
• Message formats depend on the type of message and the channel that is used to 
deliver the message.

35
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Communications Protocols
Message Formatting and Encapsulation (Contd.)
Analogy:
• When sending a letter, correct format is 
required. An envelope has the address 
of the sender and receiver, each located 
at the proper place on the envelope. 
• The process of placing one message 
format (the letter) inside another 
message format (the envelope) is called 
encapsulation.
• De-encapsulation occurs when the 
process is reversed by the recipient and 
the letter is removed from the envelope.

36
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Communications Protocols
Message Formatting and Encapsulation (Contd.)
Network:
• Similar to sending a letter, a message 
that is sent over a computer network 
follows specific format rules for it to be 
delivered and processed.
• Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol with 
a similar function to the envelope 
example.
• IP is responsible for sending a 
message from the message source to 
destination over one or more networks.

37
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Communications Protocols
Message Size
Another rule of communication is message 
size.
Analogy: 
• When people communicate with each 
other, the messages that they send are 
usually broken into smaller parts or 
sentences. 
• These sentences are limited in size to 
what the receiving person can process at 
one time. It also makes it easier for the 
receiver to read and comprehend.

38
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Communications Protocols
Message Size (Contd.)
Network: 
• Encoding between hosts must be in an 
appropriate format for the medium.
• Messages sent across the network are first 
converted into bits by the sending host
• Each bit is encoded into a pattern of 
sounds, light waves, or electrical impulses 
depending on the network media over which 
the bits are transmitted.
• The destination host receives and decodes 
the signals to interpret the message.

39
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Communications Protocols
Message Timing
Message timing includes the following:
• Flow Control - Flow control defines how much 
information can be sent and the speed at which 
it can be delivered. 
• Response Timeout - Hosts on the network 
use network protocols that specify how long to 
wait for responses and what action to take if a 
response timeout occurs.
• Access method - This determines when 
someone can send a message. When a device 
wants to transmit on a wireless LAN, it is 
necessary for the WLAN NIC to determine 
whether the wireless medium is available.

40
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Communications Protocols
Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast
A message can be delivered in different ways. Hosts on a network various delivery options to 
communicate. The different methods of communication are called as unicast, multicast, and broadcast.
Unicast: A one-to-one 
delivery option means 
there is only a single 
destination for the 
message. 
Multicast: When a host 
needs to send 
messages using a one-
to many delivery option.
Broadcast: If all hosts on the 
network need to receive the 
message at the same time, a 
broadcast may be used. 
Broadcasting represents a one-to-
all message delivery option.

Communications Protocols
The Benefits of Using a Layered Model
A layered model is used to modularize the operations of 
a network into manageable layers. These are the 
benefits of using a layered model:
• Assisting in protocol design 
• Fostering competition 
• Preventing technology or capability changes 
• Providing a common language
Two layered models that are used to describe network 
operations are:
• Open System Interconnection (OSI) Reference 
Model
• TCP/IP Reference Model

42
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Communications Protocols
The OSI Reference Model
• The OSI reference model provides list of functions and services that can occur at each layer. 
• This type of model provides consistency within all types of network protocols and services 
by describing what must be done at a particular layer, but not prescribing how it should be 
accomplished.
• It also describes the interaction of each layer with the layers directly above and below.
• Note that while the TCP/IP model layers are referred only by name but the seven OSI model 
layers are more often referred by number rather than by name. 

43
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Communications Protocols
The OSI Reference Model (Contd.)
OSI Model Layer
Description
7 - Application
Contains protocols used for process-to-process communications
6 - Presentation
Provides representation of the data transferred between application layer services
5 - Session
Provides services to the presentation layer to organize its dialogue and to manage data 
exchange
4 - Transport
Defines services to segment, transfer, and reassemble the data for individual 
communications between the end devices
3 - Network
Provides services to exchange the individual pieces of data over the network
2 - Data Link
Describe methods for exchanging data frames between devices over a common media
1 - Physical
Describe the mechanical, electrical, functional, and procedural means to activate, 
maintain, and de-activate physical connections for a bit transmission between devices

44
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Communications Protocols
The TCP/IP Protocol Model
• The TCP/IP protocol model is also referred to as the internet model.
• It describes the functions that occur at each layer of protocols within the TCP/IP suite. 
TCP/IP is also used as a reference model. 
TCP/IP Model Layer
Description
4 - Application
Represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog control
3 - Transport
Supports communication between various devices across 
diverse networks
2 - Internet
Determines the best path through the network
1 - Network Access
Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the 
network

5.3 Data Encapsulation

46
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Data Encapsulation
Segmenting Messages
• If large streams of data is sent across a 
network, it would result in delays. If any 
link in the interconnected network failed 
during the transmission, it will result in 
lost of complete message.
• Segmentation is the process of dividing a 
stream of data into smaller units for 
transmissions over the network. 
• Segmentation is necessary as networks 
use the TCP/IP protocol to send data in 
individual IP packets. Each packet is sent 
separately and the packets containing 
segments for the same destination can 
be sent over different paths.

47
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Data Encapsulation
Segmenting Messages (Contd.)
Benefits of segmenting messages:
• Increases speed - As a large data stream 
is segmented into packets, more data can 
be sent over the network without tying up a 
communications link. This allows many 
different conversations to be interleaved on 
the network called multiplexing.
• Increases efficiency - If a single segment 
fails to reach its destination, only that 
segment needs to be retransmitted instead 
of resending the entire data stream.

48
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Data Encapsulation
Sequencing
• While transmitting messages using 
segmentation and multiplexing, there is 
a possibility of data to reach the 
destination in a collapsed order.
• Each segment of the message must go 
through a sequencing process to ensure 
that it gets to the correct destination and 
can be reassembled similar to the 
content of the original message.
• TCP is responsible for sequencing the 
individual segments

49
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Data Encapsulation
Protocol Data Units
• As application data is passed down the protocol stack on its way to be transmitted across the 
network media, various protocol information is added at each level. This is known as the 
encapsulation process.
• The form that a piece of data takes at any layer is called a Protocol Data Unit (PDU). 
• During encapsulation, each succeeding layer encapsulates the PDU that it receives from the 
layer above in accordance with the protocol being used. 
• At each stage of the process, a PDU has a different name to reflect its new functions. 
Note: Although the UDP PDU is called datagram, IP packets are sometimes also referred to as IP datagrams.

50
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Data Encapsulation
Protocol Data Units (Contd.)
• The PDUs for each form of data are:
• Data - The general term for the PDU used 
at the application layer
• Segment - Transport layer PDU
• Packet - Network layer PDU
• Frame - Data Link layer PDU
• Bits - Physical layer PDU used when 
physically transmitting data over the 
medium
Note: If the Transport header is TCP, then it is a segment. If the Transport header is UDP then it is a datagram.

51

Data Encapsulation
Three Addresses
• Network protocols require addresses to be used for network 
communication.
• The OSI transport, network, and data link layers use 
addressing in some form.
• The transport layer uses protocol addresses in the form of 
port numbers to identify network applications.
• The network layer specifies addresses that identify the 
networks that clients and servers are attached to.
• Data link layer specifies the devices on the local LAN that 
should handle data frames.
• All three addresses are required for client-server 
communication.

52
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Data Encapsulation
Encapsulation Example
• When messages are being sent on a 
network, the encapsulation process 
works from top to bottom.
• At each layer, the upper layer 
information is considered data within 
the encapsulated protocol. For 
example, the TCP segment is 
considered data within the IP packet.

53
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Data Encapsulation
De-encapsulation Example
• This process is reversed at the 
receiving host and is known as     
de-encapsulation.
• De-encapsulation is the process 
used by a receiving device to 
remove one or more of the protocol 
headers. 
• The data is de-encapsulated as it 
moves up the stack toward the end-
user application.

What Did I Learn in this Module? (Contd.)
• Common protocols at the application layer of the suite are DNS, DHCP, POP3, and HTTPS.
• The OSI model has seven layers. The TCP/IP model has four layers.
• Data is broken into a series of smaller pieces and sent over the network. This is called 
segmentation. 
• Increased speed is gained because many data conversations can happen at the same time 
on the network. This is called multiplexing. 
• As data is passed down the protocol stack to be sent, different information is added by each 
layer. This process is called encapsulation. 
• The form that data takes at different layer is called a protocol data unit (PDU)
• De-encapsulation is the process used by a receiving device to remove one or more of the 
protocol headers.

Ethernet and Internet Protocol (IP)
Ethernet Encapsulation
• Unlike wireless, Ethernet uses wired 
communications, including twisted pair, 
fiber-optic links, and coaxial cables.
• Ethernet operates in the data link layer 
and physical layer.
•
It is a family of networking technologies 
defined in the IEEE 802.2 and 802.3 
standards.
• Ethernet supports data bandwidths from  
10 Mbps to 100,000 Mbps (100 Gbps)
• As seen in the figure, Ethernet standards 
define both the Layer 2 protocols and the 
Layer 1 technologies.

Ethernet Frame Fields
• The minimum Ethernet frame size is 64 bytes and the maximum is 1518 bytes. This includes 
all bytes from the destination MAC address field through the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) 
field.
• Any frame less than 64 bytes in length is considered a “collision fragment” or “runt frame” and 
is automatically discarded by receiving stations. Frames with more than 1500 bytes of data are 
considered “jumbo” or “baby giant frames”.

Description
Preamble and Start Frame 
Delimiter
Used for synchronization between the sending and receiving devices.
Destination MAC Address
It is the identifier for the intended recipient. This address is used by Layer 2 to 
assist devices in determining if a frame is addressed to them. The address in 
the frame is compared to the MAC address in the device.
Source MAC Address
Identifies the originating NIC or interface of the frame.
Type / Length
Identifies the upper layer protocol encapsulated in the Ethernet frame.
Data Field
Contains the encapsulated data from a higher layer, an IPv4 packet.
Frame Check Sequence
Used to detect errors in a frame using Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC).

MAC Address Format
• An Ethernet MAC address 
is a 48-bit binary value 
expressed as 12 
hexadecimal digits.
• Hexadecimal digits uses 
numbers 0 to 9 and the 
letters A to F. 
• Hexadecimal is commonly 
used to represent binary 
data.
• All data that travels on the 
network is encapsulated in 
Ethernet frames.

IPv4
The Network Layer
• The network layer provides services to allow end devices to exchange data across networks.
• IPv4 and IPv6 are the principle network layer 
communication protocols. 
• Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Internet 
Control Message Protocol (ICMP) are other 
network layer protocols.
Basic operations of network layer protocol:
• Addressing end devices - Configured with a 
unique IP address for identification
• Encapsulation - Encapsulates the Protocol Data 
Unit (PDU) from the transport layer into a packet.
• Routing - Select the best path and direct packets 
towards destination host.
• De-encapsulation – Performed by the destination 
host.

IPv4
The Network Layer (Contd.)
• Network layer communication 
protocols specify the packet structure 
and processing used to carry the data 
from one host to another host.
• Operating without regard to the data 
carried in each packet allows the 
network layer to carry packets for 
multiple types of communications 
between multiple hosts.

animation that demonstrates the 
exchange of data.

IPv4
IP Encapsulation
• IP encapsulates the transport layer segment or other data by adding an IP header. 
• IP Header is used to deliver the packet to the 
destination host. It is examined by Layer 3 devices.
• The process of encapsulating data layer by layer 
enables the services at the different layers to 
develop and scale without affecting the other 
layers.
• IP addressing information remains the same from 
the time the packet leaves the source host until it 
arrives at the destination host, except when 
translated by the device performing Network 
Address Translation (NAT) for IPv4.
• The encapsulated transport layer PDU or other 
data, remains unchanged during the network layer 
processes.

IPv4
Characteristics of IP
IP was designed as a protocol with low overhead.
IP provides the functions that are necessary to deliver a packet from a source to a 
destination over an interconnected system of networks. 
The basic characteristics of IP are as follows:
• Connectionless - There is no connection with the destination established before sending 
data packets.
• Best Effort - IP is inherently unreliable because packet delivery is not guaranteed.
• Media Independent - Operation is independent of the medium (for example, copper, 
fiber-optic, or wireless) carrying the data.

22

IPv4
Connectionless
Connectionless - Analogy
• There is no dedicated end-to-end 
connection created by IP before 
data is sent.
• Connectionless communication is 
conceptually similar to sending a 
letter to someone without notifying 
the recipient in advance. 
Connectionless - Network
• IP requires no initial exchange of 
control information to establish an 
end-to-end connection before 
packets are forwarded.

IPv4
Best Effort
• As an unreliable network layer 
protocol, IP protocol does not 
guarantee that all the sent 
packets will be received. 
• Other protocols manage the 
process of tracking packets 
and ensuring their delivery.
• The figure illustrates the 
unreliable or best-effort 
delivery characteristic of the IP 
protocol.

IPv4
Media Independent
• IP operates independently of the media that 
carry the data at lower layers of the protocol 
stack. 
• IP packets can be communicated as electronic 
signals over copper cable, as optical signals 
over fiber, or wirelessly as radio signals.
• The OSI data link layer is responsible for taking 
an IP packet and preparing it for transmission 
over the communications medium. 
• The maximum size of the PDU that each 
medium can transport is referred to as the 
Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU). 
• The data link layer passes the MTU value up to the network layer. Later, the network layer 
determines the size of the large packets.

IPv4
IPv4 Packet Header
• IPv4 is one of the primary network layer communication protocols. 
• The IPv4 packet header is used to ensure that this packet is delivered to its next stop on the 
way to its destination end device.
• An IPv4 packet header consists of fields containing important information about the packet. 
• These fields contain binary numbers which are examined by the Layer 3 process.

IPv4 Packet Header Fields
The significant fields in the IPv4 header 
include the following:
• Version
• Differentiated Services or DiffServ (DS)
• Header Checksum
• Time to Live (TTL)
• Protocol
• Source IPv4 Address
• Destination IPv4 Address

IP Addressing Basics
Network and Host Portions
• An IPv4 address is a 32-bit hierarchical address that is made up of a network portion and a 
host portion. 
• The bits within the network portion of the address must be identical for all devices that are 
in the same network. 
• The bits within the host portion of the address must be unique to identify a specific host 
within a network. 
• If two hosts have the same bit-pattern in the specified network portion of the 32-bit stream, 
then those two hosts will reside in the same network.

29

IP Addressing Basics
The Subnet Mask
To assign IPv4 address to a host requires the following:
• IPv4 address - Unique IPv4 address of the host.
• Subnet mask- Used to identify the network/host portion.
Note: A default gateway IPv4 address is required to reach 
remote networks and DNS server IPv4 addresses are 
required to translate domain names to IPv4 addresses.
Subnet Mask
•
When an IPv4 address is assigned to a 
device, the subnet mask is used to 
determine the network address of the 
device.
•
Subnet mask is a consecutive sequence of 1 
bits followed by a consecutive sequence of 0 
bits.

30
© 2020 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.  Cisco Confidential
IP Addressing Basics
The Subnet Mask (Contd.)
• To identify the network and host 
portions of an IPv4 address, the 
subnet mask is compared to the 
IPv4 address bit for bit, from left 
to right as shown in the figure.
• The subnet mask does not 
actually contain the network or 
host portion of an IPv4 address.
• The actual process used to 
identify the network portion and 
host portion is called ANDing.

IP Addressing Basics
The Prefix Length
• The prefix length is the number of bits set to 1 in the subnet mask.
• It is written in “slash notation”, which is noted by a forward slash (/) followed by the 
number of bits set to 1. 
• When representing an IPv4 address using a prefix length, the IPv4 address is written 
followed by the prefix length with no spaces.
Note: A network address is also referred to as a prefix or network prefix. Therefore, the 
prefix length is the number of 1 bits in the subnet mask.
• When representing an IPv4 address using a prefix length, the IPv4 address is written 
followed by the prefix length with no spaces. For example, 192.168.10.10 
255.255.255.0 would be written as 192.168.10.10/24.

IP Addressing Basics
Determining the Network: Logical AND
• A logical AND is one of three Boolean operations used in Boolean or digital logic.
• The AND operation is used in determining the network address.
• Logical AND is the comparison of two bits that produce the results as shown below
• 1 AND 1 = 1
• 0 AND 1 = 0
• 1 AND 0 = 0
• 0 AND 0 = 0
• To identify the network address of an IPv4 host, the IPv4 address is logically ANDed, bit by bit, 
with the subnet mask.
Note: In digital logic, 1 represents True and 0 represents False. When using an AND operation, 
both input values must be True (1) for the result to be True (1).

IP Addressing Basics
Determining the Network: Logical AND (Contd.)
• To illustrate how AND is used to discover a network address, consider a host with IPv4 
address 192.168.10.10 and subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, as shown in the figure:
• IPv4 host address (192.168.10.10) -
The IPv4 address of the host in dotted 
decimal and binary formats.
• Subnet mask (255.255.255.0) - The 
subnet mask of the host in dotted 
decimal and binary formats.
• Network address (192.168.10.0) - The 
logical AND operation between the IPv4 
address and subnet mask results in an 
IPv4 network address shown in dotted 
decimal and binary formats.

Subnetting Broadcast Domains
• In the figure, LAN 1 connects 400 users that could 
each generate broadcast traffic, which can slow 
down network and device operations.
• The solution is to reduce the size of the network 
to create smaller broadcast domains in a process 
called subnetting. These smaller network spaces 
are called subnets.
• Subnetting reduces the overall network traffic and 
improves network performance.
Note: The terms subnet and network are often 
used interchangeably. Most networks are a 
subnet of some larger address block.

Address Classes
The IPv4 addresses were based on the following classes:
• Class A (0.0.0.0/8 to 127.0.0.0/8) – Designed to support extremely large networks with 
more than 16 million host addresses.
• Class B (128.0.0.0 /16 – 191.255.0.0 /16) – Designed to support moderate to large size 
networks with up to approximately 65,000 host addresses.
• Class C (192.0.0.0 /24 – 223.255.255.0 /24) – Designed to support small networks with a 
maximum of 254 hosts.
Note: There is also a Class D multicast block consisting of 224.0.0.0 to 239.0.0.0 and a 
Class E experimental address block consisting of 240.0.0.0 – 255.0.0.0.

Types of IPv4 Addresses
Reserved Private Addresses
Private Addresses:
• There are blocks of addresses called private addresses that are used by most organizations 
to assign IPv4 addresses to internal hosts.
• Private IPv4 addresses are not unique and can be used by any internal network.
Private address blocks:
• 10.0.0.0 /8 or 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
• 172.16.0.0 /12 or 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
• 192.168.0.0 /16 or 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
•
The addresses within these address blocks are not allowed on the internet and must be 
filtered by internet routers.

Reserved Private Addresses (Contd.)
• In the figure, users in networks 
1, 2, or 3 are sending packets to 
remote destinations. The ISP 
routers would see that the 
source IPv4 addresses in the 
packets are from private 
addresses and discard the 
packets.
• Most organizations use private 
IPv4 addresses for their internal 
hosts. 
• Network Address Translation 
(NAT) is used to translate 
between private IPv4 and public 
IPv4 addresses.

The Default Gateway
Host Forwarding Decision
• Another role of the network layer is to direct packets between hosts. A host can send a packet 
to: Itself, Local host, and Remote host.
• The figure illustrates PC1 connecting to a local host on the same network, and to a remote 
host located on another network.
• Whether a packet is destined for a local host or a remote host is determined by the source 
end device. The method of determination varies by IP version:
•
In IPv4 - The source device uses its 
own subnet mask along with its own 
IPv4 address and the destination 
IPv4 address to make this 
determination.
•
In IPv6 - The local router advertises 
the local network address to all 
devices on the network.

45

The Default Gateway
Default Gateway
• The default gateway is the network device that can route traffic to other networks. 
• On a network, a default gateway is usually a router with these features:
• It has a local IP address in the same address range as other hosts on the local network.
• It can accept data into the local network and forward data out of the local network.
• It routes traffic to other networks.
• A default gateway is required to send traffic outside the local network. 
• Traffic cannot be forwarded outside the local network if there is no default gateway, or the 
default gateway address is not configured, or the default gateway is down.

46
© 2020 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.  Cisco Confidential
The Default Gateway
A Host Routes to the Default Gateway
•
In IPv4, the host receives the IPv4 
address of the default gateway either 
dynamically from Dynamic Host 
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or 
configured manually.
•
In IPv6, the router advertises the 
default gateway address or the host 
can be configured manually.
• Having a default gateway configured 
creates a default route in the routing 
table of the PC. 
• A default route is the route or pathway 
your computer will take when it tries to 
contact a remote network.
PC1 and PC2 are configured with the IPv4 address of 
192.168.10.1 as the default gateway

• On a Windows host, the route print or netstat -r command can be used to display the host 
routing table. Both commands generate the same output. 
• The figure displays a sample topology and the output generated by the netstat –r command.

IPv6
Need for IPv6
• IPv6 is designed to be the successor to IPv4.
• IPv6 has a larger 128-bit address space, 
providing 340 undecillion possible addresses.
• Mobile providers have been leading the way 
with the transition to IPv6. 
• Most top ISPs and content providers such as 
YouTube, Facebook, and Netflix, have also 
made the transition.
• Many companies like Microsoft, Facebook, 
and LinkedIn are transitioning to IPv6-only 
internally.
• The depletion of IPv4 address space has 
been the motivating factor for moving to 
IPv6.

Internet of Things
• The internet of today is more than email, web pages, and file transfers between computers. 
• The evolving internet is becoming an Internet of Things (IoT). 
• Computers, tablets, and smartphones will not be the only devices accessing the internet but 
there will also be sensor-equipped, internet-ready devices of tomorrow including everything 
from automobiles and biomedical devices, to household appliances and natural 
ecosystems.
• With an increasing internet population, a limited IPv4 address space, issues with NAT and 
the IoT, the time has come to begin the transition to IPv6.

IPv6
IPv6 Addressing Formats
• IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length 
and written as a string of hexadecimal 
values.
• Every four bits is represented by a 
single hexadecimal digit for a total of 32 
hexadecimal values.
• IPv6 addresses are not case-sensitive 
and can be written in either lowercase 
or uppercase.
16-bit Segments or Hextets

IPv6 Addressing Formats (Contd.)
Preferred Format
• The preferred format for writing an IPv6 address is x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x, with each “x” consisting 
of four hexadecimal values. 
• Each “x” is a single hextet which is 16 bits or four hexadecimal digits.
Examples of IPv6 addresses in the preferred format

IPv6
Rule 1 - Omit Leading Zeros
• Rule 1: Omit any leading 0s (zeros) in any hextet. 
• The four examples of ways to omit leading zeros:
• 01ab can be represented as 1ab
• 09f0 can be represented as 9f0
• 0a00 can be represented as a00
• 00ab can be represented as ab
• This rule only applies to leading 0s, NOT to trailing 0s, otherwise the address would be 
ambiguous. 01ab. For example, refer to the below table.
Type
Format
Preferred
2001 : 0db8 : 0000 : 1111 : 0000 : 0000 : 0000 : 0200
No leading 0s
2001 : db8 : 0 : 1111 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 200

55

IPv6
Rule 2 - Double Colon
Rule 2: Double colon (::) can replace any single, contiguous string of one or more 16-bit hextets 
consisting of all zeros. 
• Example: 2001:db8:cafe:1:0:0:0:1 could be represented as 2001:db8:cafe:1::1. 
• The double colon (::) is used in place of the three all-0 hextets (0:0:0).
• The double colon (::) can only be used once within an address.
• When used with the omitting leading 0s technique, the notation of IPv6 address can often be 
greatly reduced. This is commonly known as the compressed format.

IPv6
IPv6 Prefix Length
• The prefix can be identified by a dotted-decimal subnet mask or prefix length (slash notation).
•
For example, an IPv4 address of 192.168.1.10 with dotted-decimal subnet mask 
255.255.255.0 is equivalent to 192.168.1.10/24.
•
In IPv4 the /24 is called the prefix, whereas in Pv6 it is called the prefix length. 
•
Similar to IPv4, the prefix length is represented in slash notation and is used to indicate the 
network portion of an IPv6 address. It can range from 0 to128.
•
It is strongly recommended to use a 64-bit Interface ID for most networks.

Ethernet and IP Protocol Summary
What Did I Learn in this Module?
• Ethernet and wireless LANs (WLANs) are the two most popular LAN technologies. It 
operates at the physical and data link layers of the OSI model and are defined in the IEEE 
802.2 and 802.3 standards.
• The MAC address can be represented using dashes, colons, or periods between the groups 
of digits.
• IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6) are the principle network layer communication 
protocols.
• Network layer protocols perform four basic operations such as addressing end devices, 
encapsulation, routing, and de-encapsulation
• An IPv4 address is a 32-bit hierarchical address that identifies a network and a host on the 
network. An IPv6 address is a 128-bit hierarchical address.
• The prefix length is the number of bits that are set to 1 in the subnet mask. It is written in 
“slash notation”, which is noted by a forward slash (/) followed by the number of bits that are 
set to 1.

Ethernet and IP Protocol Summary
What Did I Learn in this Module?
• The process that is used to identify the network portion and host portion is called ANDing.
• Class A, Class B, and Class C are the different ranges of IP addresses.
• The router that is connected to the local network segment is referred to as the default 
gateway. 
• On a Windows host, the route print or netstat -r command can be used to display the host 
routing table.
• There are two rules that help to reduce the number of digits that are needed to represent an 
IPv6 address.
• The prefix length can range from 0 to 128.

Connectivity Verification
ICMPv4 Messages
• The TCP/IP suite provide messages to be sent in the event of certain errors. These 
messages are sent using the services of ICMP. 
• The purpose of these messages is to provide feedback about issues related to the 
processing of IP packets under certain conditions.
• ICMP messages are not required and are often not allowed within a network for security 
reasons.
• ICMP is available for both IPv4 and IPv6. ICMPv4 is the messaging protocol for IPv4. 
ICMPv6 provides the same services for IPv6 but includes additional functionality.
• ICMP messages common to both ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 include host confirmation, 
destination or service unreachable, time exceeded and route redirection.

Connectivity Verification
ICMPv4 Messages (Contd.)
Host Confirmation
• An ICMP Echo Message can be 
used to determine if a host is 
operational. 
• The local host sends an ICMP 
Echo Request to a host. If the 
host is available, the destination 
host responds with an Echo 
Reply. 
• This use of the ICMP Echo 
messages is the basis of the 
ping utility.

ICMPv4 Messages (Contd.)
Destination or Service Unreachable
• When a host or gateway receives a packet that it cannot deliver, it can use an ICMP 
Destination Unreachable message to notify the source that the destination or service is 
unreachable. 
• The message will include a code that indicates why the packet could not be delivered. The 
Destination Unreachable codes for ICMPv4 includes the following:
• 0 - Net unreachable
• 1 - Host unreachable
• 2 - Protocol unreachable
• 3 - Port unreachable
Note: ICMPv6 has slightly different codes for Destination Unreachable messages.

Connectivity Verification
ICMPv4 Messages (Contd.)
Time Exceeded
• An ICMPv4 Time Exceeded message is used by a router to indicate that a packet cannot be 
forwarded because the Time to Live (TTL) field of the packet was decremented to 0. 
• If a router receives a packet and decrements the TTL field in the IPv4 packet to zero, it 
discards the packet and sends a Time Exceeded message to the source host.
• ICMPv6 also sends a Time Exceeded message if the router cannot forward an IPv6 packet 
because the packet has expired. 
• IPv6 does not have a TTL field. It uses the hop limit field to determine if the packet has 
expired.

ICMPv6 RS and RA Messages
• ICMPv6 has new features and improved functionality not found in ICMPv4. ICMPv6 
messages are encapsulated in IPv6.
• It has four new protocols as part of the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ND or NDP).
• Messaging between an IPv6 router and an IPv6 device:
•
Router Solicitation (RS) message
•
Router Advertisement (RA) message
• Messaging between IPv6 devices:
•
Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message
•
Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message

ICMPv6 RS and RA Messages (Contd.)
Router Solicitation: Messaging Between an IPv6 Router and an IPv6 Device
• RA messages are sent by routers to provide addressing information to hosts using Stateless 
Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC).
• A router will send an RA message periodically or in response to an RS message. A host using 
SLAAC will set its default gateway to the link-local address of the router that sent the RA.
• When a host is configured to obtain its addressing information automatically using SLAAC, 
the host will send an RS message to the router requesting an RA message.

Connectivity Verification
ICMPv6 RS and RA Messages (Contd.)
Address Resolution: Messaging Between IPv6 Devices 
• NA messages are sent when a device knows the IPv6 address of a device but does not know 
its MAC address. This is equivalent to an ARP Request for IPv4.
• NA messages are sent in response to an NS message and match the target IPv6 address in 
the NS. The NA message includes the device’s Ethernet MAC address. This is equivalent to 
an ARP Reply in IPv4.

Connectivity Verification
ICMPv6 RS and RA Messages (Contd.)
Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)
• When a device is assigned a global unicast or link-local unicast address, the DAD is performed 
on the address to ensure that it is unique. 
• To check the uniqueness of an address, the device will send an NS message with its own IPv6 
address.
• If another device on the network has this address, it will respond with an NA message which 
will notify the sending device that the address is in use. If a corresponding NA message is not 
returned within a certain period of time, the unicast address is unique and acceptable for use.

Ping and Traceroute Utilities
Ping – Test Connectivity
• Ping is an IPv4 and IPv6 testing utility that uses ICMP echo request and echo reply 
messages to test connectivity between hosts. 
• To test connectivity to another host on a network, an echo request is sent to the host address 
using the ping command. If the host at the specified address receives the echo request, it 
responds with an echo reply.
• As each echo reply is received, ping provides feedback on the time between when the 
request was sent and when the reply was received. This can be a measure of network 
performance.
• Ping has a timeout value for the reply. If a reply is not received within the timeout, ping 
provides a message indicating that a response was not received.

22

Ping and Traceroute Utilities
Ping – Test Connectivity (Contd.)
• After all the requests are sent, the ping utility provides a summary that includes the success 
rate and average round-trip time to the destination.
• Type of connectivity tests performed with ping include the following:
• Pinging the local loopback
• Pinging the default gateway
• Pinging the remote host

23

Ping and Traceroute Utilities
Ping the Loopback
• Ping can be used to test the internal configuration of IPv4 or IPv6 on the local host. 
• To perform this test, ping the local loopback address 
of 127.0.0.1 for IPv4 (::1 for IPv6).
• A response from 127.0.0.1 for IPv4, or ::1 for IPv6, 
indicates that IP is properly installed on the host. 
This response comes from the network layer. 
• This response tests IP down through the network 
layer of IP. 
• An error message indicates that TCP/IP is not 
operational on the host.
• Pinging the local host confirms that TCP/IP is 
installed and working on the local host.
• Pinging 127.0.0.1 causes a device to ping itself.

Ping and Traceroute Utilities
Ping the Default Gateway
• The ping can be used to test the ability of a host to communicate on the local network. This 
is done by pinging the IP address of the default gateway of the host. 
• A successful ping to the default gateway indicates that the host and the router interface 
serving as the default gateway are both operational on the local network.
• For this test, the default gateway address is mostly used as the router is always operational. 
If the default gateway address does not respond, a ping can be sent to the IP address of 
another host on the local network that is operational.
• If either the default gateway or another host responds, then the local host can successfully 
communicate over the local network. 
• If the default gateway does not respond but another host does, this could indicate a problem 
with the router interface serving as the default gateway. 
• One possibility is that the wrong default gateway address been configured on the host or the 
router interface may be fully operational but have security applied to it.

Ping the Default Gateway (Contd.)
The host pings its default gateway, 
sending an ICMP echo request. The 
default gateway sends an echo 
reply confirming connectivity.

Ping and Traceroute Utilities
Ping a Remote Host
• Ping can also be used to test the ability of a 
local host to communicate across an 
internetwork. The local host can ping an 
operational IPv4 host of a remote network.
• The router uses its IP routing table to forward 
the packets. 
• If this ping is successful, the operation of a 
large piece of the internetwork and the 
functionality of the remote host can be verified.
• A successful ping across the network confirms 
communication on the local network, the 
operation of the router as the default gateway, 
and the operation of all other routers in the 
path between the local network and the 
network of the remote host.

Ping and Traceroute Utilities
Traceroute - Test the Path
• Ping is used to test connectivity between two hosts but does not provide information about 
the details of devices between the hosts.
• Traceroute (tracert) is a utility that generates a list of hops that were successfully reached 
along the path. This list can provide important verification and troubleshooting information.
• If the data reaches the destination, then the trace lists the interface of every router in the path 
between the hosts. 
• If the data fails at some hop along the way, the address of the last router that responded to 
the trace can provide an indication of where the problem or security restrictions are found.

Ping and Traceroute Utilities
Traceroute - Test the Path (Contd.)
Round Trip Time (RTT)
• The traceroute provides a round-trip time for each hop along the path and indicates if a hop 
fails to respond.
• The round-trip time is the time a packet takes to reach the remote host and for the response 
from the host to return. 
• An asterisk (*) is used to indicate a lost or unreplied packet.
• This information can be used to locate a problematic router in the path or may indicate that 
the router is configured not to reply. 
• If the display shows high response times or data losses from a particular hop, this is an 
indication that the resources of the router or its connections may be overused.

29

Ping and Traceroute Utilities
Traceroute - Test the Path (Contd.)
IPv4 TTL and IPv6 Hop Limit: Traceroute uses the function of the TTL field in IPv4 and the Hop Limit field in 
IPv6 in the Layer 3 headers, along with the ICMP Time Exceeded message.
•
The first sequence of messages sent from 
traceroute have a TTL field value of 1 which 
causes the TTL to time out the IPv4 packet at the 
first router. This router then responds with an 
ICMPv4 Time Exceeded message. Traceroute now 
has the address of the first hop.
•
Traceroute then progressively increments the TTL 
field (2, 3, 4...) for each sequence of messages. 
This provides the trace with the address of each 
hop as the packets time out further down the path. 
The TTL field continues to be increased until the 
destination is reached.
•
After the final destination is reached, the host 
responds with either an ICMP Port Unreachable 
message or an ICMP Echo Reply message instead 
of the ICMP Time Exceeded message.

ICMP Packet Format
• ICMP is encapsulated directly into IP 
packets.
• ICMP acts as a data payload within the IP 
packet. It has a special header data field.
• It uses message codes to differentiate 
between different types of ICMP messages. 
These are some common message codes:
• 0 – Echo reply (response to a ping)
• 3 – Destination Unreachable
• 5 – Redirect (use another route to the 
destination)
• 8 – Echo request (for ping)
• 11 – Time Exceeded (TTL became 0)

End Devices
• The most familiar network devices are end 
devices. An end device is either the source 
or destination of a message transmitted 
over the network.
• To distinguish one end device from 
another, each end device on a network has 
an address.
• When an end device initiates 
communication, it uses the address of the 
destination end device to specify where to 
deliver the message.
• Data originates with an end device, flows 
through the network, and arrives at an end 
device.

Routers
• Routers are devices that operate at the 
OSI network layer (Layer 3). 
• As shown in the figure, routers are used 
to interconnect remote sites. They use 
the process of routing to forward data 
packets between networks.
• The routing process uses network routing 
tables, protocols, and algorithms to 
determine the most efficient path for 
forwarding an IP packet.
• Routers gather routing information and 
update other routers about changes in 
the network. 
The Router Connection

Network Communication Devices
Routers (Contd.)
• Routers have two primary functions: path determination and packet forwarding.
• To perform path determination, each router 
builds and maintains a routing table which is 
a database of known networks and how to 
reach them. 
• The routing table can be built manually and 
contain static routes or can be built using a 
dynamic routing protocol.
• Packet forwarding is accomplished by using 
a switching function.
• Switching is the process used by a router to 
accept a packet on one interface and forward 
it out of another interface.
• A primary aim of the switching function is to 
encapsulate packets in the appropriate data 
link frame type for the outgoing data link. 

15
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Network Communication Devices
Routers (Contd.)
• After the router has determined the exit interface using path determination, the router must 
encapsulate the packet into the data link frame of the outgoing interface.
• When a packet received from one network and destined for another network, the router 
performs the following three major steps:
• It de-encapsulates the Layer 2 frame header and trailer to expose the Layer 3 packet.
• It examines the destination IP address of the IP packet to find the best path in the routing 
table.
• If the router finds a path to the destination, it encapsulates the Layer 3 packet into a new 
Layer 2 frame and forwards that frame out the exit interface.

16
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Network Communication Devices
Routers (Contd.)
• As shown in the figure, devices have 
Layer 3 IPv4 addresses, while Ethernet 
interfaces have Layer 2 data link 
addresses. The MAC addresses are 
shortened to simplify the illustration. 
• As a packet travels from the source 
device to the final destination device, 
the Layer 3 IP addresses do not 
change as the Layer 3 PDU does not 
change. 
• The Layer 2 data link addresses 
change at every router on the path to 
the destination, as the packet is de-
encapsulated and re-encapsulated in a 
new Layer 2 frame.

Network Communication Devices
Packet Forwarding Decision Process
Now, router must determine how to encapsulate the packet and forward it out the correct egress 
interface. The following steps describe the packet forwarding process shown in the figure:
•
The data link frame with an 
encapsulated IP packet arrives on the 
ingress interface.
•
The router examines the destination IP 
address in the packet header and 
consults its IP routing table.
•
The router finds the longest matching 
prefix in the routing table.
•
The router encapsulates the packet in 
a data link frame and forwards it out 
the egress interface.
•
The destination could be a device 
connected to the network or a next-
hop router.
•
If there is no matching route entry the 
packet is dropped.

18

Network Communication Devices
Packet Forwarding Decision Process (Contd.)
The three actions a router can perform with a packet, after the best path is determined:
• Forwards the Packet to a Device on a Directly Connected Network
• Forwards the Packet to a Next-Hop Router
• Drops the Packet - No Match in Routing Table
Forwards the Packet to a Device on a Directly Connected Network
• If the route entry indicates that the egress interface is a directly connected network, this 
means that the destination IP address of the packet belongs to a device on the directly 
connected network.
• The packet can be forwarded directly to the destination device, an end device on an Ethernet 
LAN, which means the packet must be encapsulated in an Ethernet frame.
§ To encapsulate the packet in the Ethernet frame, the router needs to determine the 
destination MAC address associated with the destination IP address of the packet.

19
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Network Communication Devices
Packet Forwarding Decision Process (Contd.)
The process varies based on whether the packet is an IPv4 or IPv6 packet.
IPv4 packet:
•
The router checks its ARP table for the destination IPv4 address and an associated Ethernet 
MAC address.
•
If there is no match, the router sends an ARP Request and the destination device will return 
an ARP Reply with its MAC address. 
•
The router can now forward the IPv4 packet in an Ethernet frame with the proper destination 
MAC address.
IPv6 packet:
•
The router checks its neighbor cache for the destination IPv6 address and an associated 
Ethernet MAC address.
•
If there is no match, the router sends an ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message and the 
destination device will return an ICMPv6 Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message with its MAC 
address.
•
The router can now forward the IPv6 packet in an Ethernet frame with the proper destination 
MAC address.

20

Network Communication Devices
Packet Forwarding Decision Process (Contd.)
Forwards the Packet to a Next-Hop Router
• If the route entry indicates that the destination IP address is on a remote network, this means 
the destination IP address of the packet belongs to a device on network that is not directly 
connected. 
• Therefore, the packet must be forwarded to another router, specifically a next-hop router. The 
next-hop address is indicated in the route entry.
• If the forwarding router and the next-hop router are on an Ethernet network, a similar process 
(ARP and ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery) will occur for determining the destination MAC 
address of the packet. The difference is that the router will search for the IP address of the 
next-hop router in its ARP table or neighbor cache, instead of the destination IP address.
Drops the Packet - No Match in Routing Table
• If there is no match between the destination IP address and a prefix in the routing table, and 
if there is no default route, the packet will be dropped.

Routing Information
• The routing table stores the following information:
• Directly connected routes - These routes come from the active router interfaces. Routers 
add a directly connected route when an interface is configured with an IP address and is 
activated.
• Remote routes - These are remote networks connected to other routers.
• A routing table is a data file in RAM that is used to store route information about directly 
connected and remote networks. 
• The routing table contains network or next hop associations. These associations tell a router 
that a particular destination can be optimally reached by sending the packet to a specific 
router that represents the next hop on the way to the final destination. 
• The next hop association can also be the outgoing or exit interface to the next destination.

Routing Information (Contd.)
• The destination network entries in the routing table can be added in several ways:
• Local Route interfaces – These are added when an interface is configured and active. 
This entry is only displayed in IOS 15 or newer for IPv4 routes, and all IOS releases for 
IPv6 routes.
• Directly connected interfaces – These are added to the routing table when an interface is 
configured and active.
• Static routes – These are added when a route is manually configured and the exit 
interface is active. 
• Dynamic routing protocol – This is added when routing protocols that dynamically learn 
about the network, such as EIGRP or OSPF, are implemented and networks are identified.
• Dynamic routing protocols exchange network reachability information between routers and 
dynamically adapt to network changes.

Routing Information (Contd.)
• One of the first dynamic routing protocols was RIP. RIPv1 was released in 1988.
• To address the needs of larger networks, two advanced routing protocols Open Shortest Path 
First (OSPF) and Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) were developed.
• Cisco developed the Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) and Enhanced IGRP (EIGRP) 
which also scales well in larger network implementations. 
• The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is now used between Internet Service Providers (ISPs) 
and their larger private clients to exchange routing information. 
• The following table classifies the protocols:

End-to-End Packet Forwarding
The primary responsibility of the packet forwarding function is to encapsulate packets in the 
appropriate data link frame type for the outgoing interface. The process of packet forwarding is 
described through the following example.
PC1 Sends Packet to PC2
•
In the first animation, PC1 
sends a packet to PC2.
•
Note that if an ARP entry does 
not exist in the ARP table for 
the default gateway of 
192.168.1.1, PC1 sends an 
ARP request. 
•
Router R1 then return an ARP 
reply.

Network Communication Devices
End-to-End Packet Forwarding (Contd.)
R1 Forwards the Packet to PC2
• R1 now forwards the packet to PC2.
• Because the exit interface is on an 
Ethernet network, R1 must resolve 
the next-hop IPv4 address with a 
destination MAC address using its 
ARP table.
• If an ARP entry does not exist in the 
ARP table for the next-hop interface 
of 192.168.2.2, R1 sends an ARP 
request.
• R2 would then return an ARP Reply.

27

Network Communication Devices
End-to-End Packet Forwarding (Contd.)
R2 Forwards the Packet to R3
• R2 now forwards the packet to R3.
• As the exit interface is not an Ethernet 
network, R2 does not have to resolve the 
next-hop IPv4 address with a destination 
MAC address.
• When the interface is a point-to-point 
(P2P) serial connection, the router 
encapsulates the IPv4 packet into the 
proper data link frame format used by the 
exit interface. 
• As there are no MAC addresses on serial 
interfaces, R2 sets the data link destination 
address to an equivalent of a broadcast.

Network Communication Devices
End-to-End Packet Forwarding (Contd.)
R3 Forwards the Packet to PC2
• R3 now forwards the packet to PC2. 
• As the destination IPv4 address is 
on a directly connected Ethernet 
network, R3 must resolve the 
destination IPv4 address of the 
packet with its associated MAC 
address.
• If the entry is not in the ARP table, 
R3 sends an ARP request out of its 
FastEthernet 0/0 interface.
• PC2 would then return an ARP reply 
with its MAC address.

Hubs, Bridges, LAN Switches
• The topology icons for hubs, bridges, and LAN switches 
are shown in the figure.
• An Ethernet hub acts as a multiport repeater that receives 
an incoming electrical signal (data) on a port. It then 
immediately forwards a regenerated signal out all other 
ports. Hubs use physical layer processing to forward data. 
• Bridges have two interfaces and are connected between 
hubs to divide the network into multiple collision domains. 
Each collision domain can have only one sender at a time. 
• LAN switches are multiport bridges that connect devices 
into a star topology. Switches also segment a LAN into 
separate collision domains, one for each switch port. A 
switch makes forwarding decisions based on Ethernet 
MAC addresses. 

31
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Network Communication Devices
Switching Operation
• Switches use MAC addresses to direct network communications through the switch, to the 
appropriate port, and toward the destination.
• A switch is made up of integrated circuits and the accompanying software that controls the 
data paths through the switch.
• For a switch to know the port to transmit a frame, it must first learn the devices existing on 
each port. As the switch learns the relationship of ports to devices, it builds a table called a 
MAC address table, or content addressable memory (CAM) table which is a special type of 
memory used in high-speed searching applications.
• LAN switches determine how to handle incoming data frames by maintaining the MAC 
address table.
• The switch uses the information in the MAC address table to send frames destined for a 
specific device out of the port to which the device is connected.

32
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Network Communication Devices
Switching Operation (Contd.)
The following two-step process is performed on every Ethernet frame that enters a switch.
Learn – Examining the Source MAC 
Address
• Every frame that enters a switch is checked 
for new MAC address information by 
examining the frame’s source MAC address 
and the port number where the frame 
entered the switch.
• If the source MAC address is not in the table, 
it is added to the MAC address table along 
with the incoming port number. 
• If the source MAC address does exist in the 
table, the switch updates the refresh timer for 
that entry. By default, most Ethernet switches 
keep an entry in the table for five minutes.
Note: If the source MAC address does exist in the table but on a different port, the switch treats this as a new 
entry. The entry is replaced using the same MAC address, but with the more current port number.

33

Network Communication Devices
Switching Operation (Contd.)
Forward – Examining the Destination MAC 
Address
• If the destination MAC address is a unicast 
address, the switch will look for a match 
between the destination MAC address of the 
frame and an entry in its MAC address table. 
• If the destination MAC address is in the 
table, it will forward the frame out the 
specified port.
• If the destination MAC address is not in the 
table, the switch will forward the frame out 
all ports except the incoming port. This is 
called an unknown unicast.
Note: If the destination MAC address is a broadcast or a multicast, the frame is also flooded out all ports 
except the incoming port.

34
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Network Communication Devices
Video - MAC Address Tables on Connected Switches
• A switch can have multiple MAC addresses associated with a single port. This is common 
when the switch is connected to another switch. The switch will have a separate MAC 
address table entry for each frame received with a different source MAC address.
• Play the video to see a demonstration of how two connected switches build their MAC 
address tables.

VLANs
• VLANs provide a way to group devices 
within a LAN.
• It provides segmentation and organizational 
flexibility within a switched internetwork.
• It allows an administrator to segment 
networks based on factors such as function, 
project team, or application, without regard 
for the physical location of the user or 
device.
• It creates a logical broadcast domain that 
can span multiple physical LAN segments.
• It prevent users on different VLANs from 
snooping on each other’s traffic.

Network Communication Devices
STP
• The Spanning Tree Protocol is used to maintain one loop-free path in the Layer 2 network, 
at any time.
• Loops and duplicate frames have severe consequences for a switched network. STP was 
developed to address these issues.
• It ensures that there is one logical path between all destinations on the network by blocking 
redundant paths. 
• A port is considered blocked when user data is prevented from entering or leaving that port. 
This does not include bridge protocol data unit (BPDU) frames that are used by STP to 
prevent loops.
• If the path is ever needed to compensate for a network cable or switch failure, STP 
recalculates the paths and unblocks the necessary ports to allow the redundant path to 
become active.

Network Communication Devices
Multilayer Switching
Multilayer switches (Layer 3 switches) perform Layer 2 switching and also forward frames 
based on Layer 3 and 4 information. 
All Cisco Catalyst multilayer switches support the following types of Layer 3 interfaces:
• Routed port - A pure Layer 3 interface similar to a physical interface on a Cisco IOS router.
• Switch virtual interface (SVI) - A virtual VLAN interface for inter-VLAN routing. In other 
words, SVIs are the virtual-routed VLAN interfaces.

38

Network Communication Devices
Multilayer Switching (Contd.)
Routed Ports
• A routed port is a physical port that acts similarly 
to an interface on a router. 
• Unlike an access port, a routed port is not 
associated with a particular VLAN. It behaves 
like a regular router interface. 
• Also, as Layer 2 functionality has been removed, 
Layer 2 protocols, such as STP, do not function 
on a routed interface. 
• Some protocols, such as LACP and 
EtherChannel, do function at Layer 3. Unlike 
Cisco IOS routers, routed ports on a Cisco IOS 
switch do not support sub interfaces.

39

Network Communication Devices
Multilayer Switching (Contd.)
Switch Virtual Interface
• An SVI is a virtual interface that is configured 
within a multilayer switch. Unlike the basic 
Layer 2 switches, a multilayer switch can 
have multiple SVIs. An SVI can be created for 
any VLAN that exists on the switch. 
• An SVI is considered to be virtual as there is 
no physical port dedicated to the interface. It 
can perform the same functions for the VLAN 
as a router interface and can be configured in 
much the same way as a router interface.
• The SVI for the VLAN provides Layer 3 
processing for packets to or from all switch 
ports associated with that VLAN.

Wireless versus Wired LANs
• WLANs use Radio Frequencies (RF) instead of cables at the physical layer and MAC 
sublayer of the data link layer. 
• The IEEE has adopted the 802 LAN/MAN portfolio of computer network architecture 
standards which includes two dominant working groups 802.3 Ethernet, which defined 
Ethernet for wired LANs and 802.11 which defined Ethernet for WLANs. 
• WLANs also differ from wired LANs as follows:
• WLANs connect clients to the network through a wireless access point (AP) or wireless 
router, instead of an Ethernet switch.
• WLANs connect mobile devices that are often battery powered, as opposed to plugged-in 
LAN devices. Wireless NICs tend to reduce the battery life of a mobile device.
• WLANs support hosts that contend for access on the RF media (frequency bands). 
• WLANs use a different frame format than wired Ethernet LANs. WLANs require additional 
information in the Layer 2 header of the frame.
• WLANs raise more privacy issues because radio frequencies can reach outside the facility.

802.11 Frame Structure
All 802.11 wireless frames contain the following fields:
•
Frame Control – This identifies the 
type of wireless frame and contains 
subfields for protocol version, frame 
type, address type, power 
management, and security settings.
•
Duration – This is used to indicate 
the remaining duration needed to 
receive the next frame transmission.
•
Address1 – This contains the MAC 
address of the receiving wireless 
device or AP.
•
Address2 – This contains the MAC 
address of the transmitting wireless 
device or AP.

802.11 Frame Structure (Contd.)
• Address3 - This contains the MAC 
address of the destination, such as 
the router interface with AP attached.
• Sequence Control – This contains 
information to control sequencing and 
fragmented frames.
• Address4 - This is usually missing as 
it is used only in ad hoc mode.
• Payload – This contains the data for 
transmission.
• FCS – This is used for Layer 2 error 
control.

Wireless Communications
CSMA/CA
• WLANs are half-duplex, shared media configurations. 
• Half-duplex means that only one client can transmit or receive at any given moment. 
• Shared media means that wireless clients can all transmit and receive on the same radio 
channel. 
• This creates a problem because a wireless client cannot hear while it is sending, which 
makes it impossible to detect a collision.
• To resolve this problem, WLANs use Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance 
(CSMA/CA) method to determine how and when to send data on the network. 

47
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Wireless Communications
CSMA/CA (Contd.)
A wireless client does the following:
• Listens to the channel to see if it is idle. The channel is also called the carrier.
• Sends a Ready To Send (RTS) message to the AP to request dedicated access to the 
network.
• Receives a Clear To Send (CTS) message from the AP granting access to send.
• If the wireless client does not receive a CTS message, it waits a random amount of time 
before restarting the process.
• After it receives the CTS, it transmits the data.
• All transmissions are acknowledged.

Wireless Communications
Wireless Client and AP Association
• For wireless devices to communicate 
over a network, they must first 
associate with an AP or wireless 
router. 
• An important part of the 802.11 
process is discovering a WLAN and 
subsequently connecting to it.
• Wireless devices complete the 
following three stage process, as 
shown in the figure:
• Discover a wireless AP
• Authenticate with AP
• Associate with AP

49
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Wireless Communications
Wireless Client and AP Association (Contd.)
In order to have a successful association, a wireless client and an AP must agree on specific 
parameters. Parameters must then be configured on the AP and subsequently on the client. 
The configurable wireless parameters include:
• SSID -The SSID name appears in the list of available wireless networks on a client.
• Password – This is required from the wireless client to authenticate to the AP.
• Network mode - This refers to the 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ad WLAN standards. 
• Security mode - This refers to the security parameter settings, such as WEP, WPA, or 
WPA2. Always enable the highest security level supported.
• Channel settings - This refers to the frequency bands used to transmit wireless data.

Wireless Communications
Passive and Active Discover Mode
Wireless devices must discover and connect to an AP or wireless router. Wireless clients 
connect to the AP using a scanning (probing) process such as passive and active.
Passive Mode
•
In this mode, the AP openly 
advertises its service by 
periodically sending broadcast 
beacon frames containing the 
SSID, supported standards, and 
security settings. 
•
The primary purpose of the 
beacon is to allow wireless clients 
to learn which networks and APs 
are available in a given area.
•
This allows the wireless clients to 
choose which network and AP to 
use. 

51
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Wireless Communications
Passive and Active Discover Mode (Contd.)
Active Mode
• In this mode, wireless clients must know the 
name of the SSID.
• The wireless client initiates the process by 
broadcasting a probe request frame on 
multiple channels includes the SSID name 
and standards supported. 
• APs configured with the SSID will send a 
probe response that includes the SSID, 
supported standards, and security settings.
• Active mode may be required if an AP is configured to not broadcast beacon frames.
• A wireless client could also send a probe request without a SSID name to discover nearby WLAN 
networks. APs configured to broadcast beacon frames would respond to the wireless client with a probe 
response and provide the SSID name.

Wireless Communications
Wireless Devices - AP, LWAP, and WLC
• A common wireless data implementation is 
enabling devices to connect wirelessly via a LAN. 
• In general, a wireless LAN requires wireless 
access points and clients that have wireless 
NICs.
• Home and small business wireless routers 
integrate the functions of a router, switch, and 
access point into one device as shown in the 
figure.
• In small networks, the wireless router may be the 
only AP as only a small area requires wireless 
coverage. 
• In larger networks, there can be many APs.

53
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Wireless Communications
Wireless Devices - AP, LWAP, and WLC (Contd.)
• All of the control and management functions of the APs on a network can be centralized into 
a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). 
• When using a WLC, the APs no longer act autonomously, but instead act as lightweight APs 
(LWAPs). 
• LWAPs only forward data between the wireless LAN and the WLC.
• All management functions, such as defining SSIDs and authentication are conducted on the 
centralized WLC rather than on each individual AP. 
• A major benefit of centralizing the AP management functions in the WLC is simplified 
configuration and monitoring of numerous access points, among many other benefits.

Network Communication Devices Summary
What Did I Learn in this Module?
• End devices that are connected to a LAN connect to other LANs using an internetwork of 
intermediary devices such as routers and switches.
• Routers are network layer (i.e., Layer 3) devices and use the process of routing to forward 
data packets between networks or sub networks. 
• Routers provide Path determination and Packet forwarding services.
• Switches segment a LAN into separate collision domains, one for each switch port. 
• A switch makes forwarding decisions based on Ethernet MAC addresses that are contained 
in the Ethernet frame.
• Switches are configured with the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to maintain a loop-free Layer 
2 path by intentionally blocking redundant paths that could cause a loop.
• Multilayer switches (also known as Layer 3 switches) not only perform Layer 2 switching, but 
also forward frames based on Layer 3 and 4 information.

The Three-Layer Network Design Model
• The campus wired LAN uses a 
hierarchical design model to separate the 
network topology into modular groups or 
layers.
• The hierarchical LAN design includes 
three layers:
•
Access - Provides endpoints and 
users direct access to the network.
•
Distribution - Aggregates access 
layers and provides connectivity to 
services. 
•
Core - Provides connectivity between 
distribution layers for large LAN 
environments.

The Three-Layer Network Design Model (Contd.)
•
Although the hierarchical model has 
three layers, some smaller enterprise 
networks may implement a two-tier 
hierarchical design.
•
In this two-tier hierarchical design, the 
core and distribution layers are 
collapsed into one layer, thus reducing 
cost and complexity.

Firewall design is primarily about device interfaces permitting or denying traffic based on the 
source, the destination, and the type of traffic. 
The three firewall designs are:
•
Public and Private
•
The public network (or outside network) is untrusted, and the private network (or 
inside network) is trusted.

Firewalls
A firewall is a system, or group of 
systems, that enforces an access control 
policy between networks.
Common Firewall Properties:
• Resistant to network attacks
• The only transit point between internal 
corporate networks and external 
networks because all traffic flows 
through the firewall
• Enforce the access control policy

Firewalls (Contd.)
Following are the benefits and limitations of firewalls:
Firewall Benefits
Firewall Limitations
Prevent the exposure of sensitive hosts, 
resources, and applications to untrusted 
users.
A misconfigured firewall can have serious consequences for 
the network, such as becoming a single point of failure.
Sanitize protocol flow, which prevents the 
exploitation of protocol flaws.
The data from many applications cannot be passed over 
firewalls securely.
Block malicious data from servers and 
clients.
Users might proactively search for ways around the firewall to 
receive blocked material, which exposes the network to 
potential attack.
Reduce security management complexity.
Network performance can slow down.
Unauthorized traffic can be tunnelled or hidden as legitimate 
traffic through the firewall.

Firewall Type Descriptions
The different types of firewalls are:
• Packet Filtering (Stateless) Firewall
• Packet Filtering firewalls are part of 
a router firewall, which permits or 
denies traffic based on Layer 3 and 
Layer 4 information. 
• They are stateless firewalls that use 
a simple policy table look-up that 
filters traffic based on specific 
criteria.

29

Firewall Type Descriptions (Contd.)
•
Stateful Firewalls
•
Stateful firewalls are the most versatile 
and the most common firewall 
technologies in use.
•
These firewalls provide stateful packet 
filtering by using connection information 
maintained in a state table.

Intrusion Prevention and Detection Devices
• A networking architecture paradigm 
shift is required to defend against 
fast-moving and evolving attacks. 
This must include cost effective and 
prevention systems such as:
•
Intrusion Detection Systems 
(IDS) 
•
Intrusion Prevention Systems 
(IPS)
• The network architecture integrates 
these solutions into the entry and 
exit points of the network.
• The figure shows how an IPS 
device handles malicious traffic.

• An Access Control List (ACL) is a series of commands that control whether a device forwards 
or drops packets based on information found in the packet header. 
• When configured, ACLs perform the 
following tasks:
•
Limit network traffic to increase network 
performance.
•
Provide traffic flow control. 
•
Provide basic level of security for 
network access. 
•
Filter traffic based on traffic type.
•

SNMP
• Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an application layer protocol that provides a 
message format for communication between managers and agents.
• It allows network administrators to perform the following:
• Manage end devices such as servers, workstations, 
routers, switches, and security appliances, on an IP 
network.
• Monitor and manage network performance.
• Find and solve network problems.
• Plan for network growth.
• The SNMP system consists of two elements:
• SNMP manager: Runs SNMP management software.

• NetFlow is a Cisco IOS technology that provides statistics on packets flowing through a 
Cisco router or multilayer switch.
• NetFlow provides data to enable:
• network and security monitoring, 
• network planning
• traffic analysis to include identification 
of network bottlenecks
• IP accounting for billing purposes.
• NetFlow can monitor application 
connection, tracking byte and packet 
counts for that individual application flow. 
• It then pushes the statistics over to an 
external server called a NetFlow collector.

Syslog Servers
• The most common method of accessing 
system messages is to use a protocol 
called syslog.
• The Syslog protocol allows networking 
devices to send their system messages 
across the network to syslog servers.
• It provides three primary functions:
• The ability to gather logging information 
for monitoring and troubleshooting
• The ability to select the type of logging 
information that is captured
• The ability to specify the destination of 
captured syslog messages

NTP
• It is important to synchronize the time across all devices on the network. The date and time 
settings on a network device can be set using one of two methods:
• Manual configuration of the date and time
• Configuring the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
• NTP networks use a hierarchical system of time 
sources, where each level in this system is called a 
stratum. NTP servers are arranged in three levels 
known as strata:
• Stratum 0: An NTP network gets the time from 
authoritative time sources.
• Stratum 1: Devices are directly connected to the 
authoritative time sources. 
• Stratum 2 and lower strata: Stratum 2 devices, 
such as NTP clients, synchronize their time using 
the NTP packets from stratum 1 servers.

AAA Servers
The below table lists the three independent security functions provided by the AAA 
architectural framework.
Functions
Description
Authentication
•
Users and administrators must prove that they are who they say they are. 
•
Authentication can be established using username and password combinations, 
challenge and response questions, token cards, and other methods. 
•
AAA authentication provides a centralized way to control access to the network.
Authorization
•
After the user is authenticated, authorization services determine which resources the 
user can access and which operations the user is allowed to perform.
•
An example is “User ‘student’ can access host serverXYZ using SSH only.”
Accounting
•
Accounting records what the user does, including what is accessed, the amount of time 
the resource is accessed, and any changes that were made. 
•
Accounting keeps track of how network resources are used. 
•
An example is "User ‘student’ accessed host serverXYZ using SSH for 15 minutes."

VPN
• A VPN is a private network that is created 
over a public network (usually the internet).
• A VPN uses virtual connections routed 
through the Internet from the organization to 
the remote site.
• A VPN is a communications environment in 
which access is strictly controlled to permit 
peer connections within a defined community 
of interest.
• Confidentiality is achieved by encrypting the 
traffic within the VPN.
• In short, VPN connects two endpoints over a 
public network, to form a logical connection 
which can be made at Layer 2 or Layer 3.

Understanding Defense
Assets, Vulnerabilities, Threats
• Cybersecurity analysts must prepare for any type of attack. It is their job to secure the assets 
of the organization’s network.
• To do this, cybersecurity analysts must first identify:
• Assets - Anything of value to an organization that must be protected including servers, 
infrastructure devices, end devices, and the greatest asset, data.
• Vulnerabilities - A weakness in a system or its design that could be exploited by a threat 
actor.
• Threats - Any potential danger to an asset.

11
© 2020 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Understanding Defense
Identify Assets
• The collection of all the devices and information owned or managed by the organization are 
the assets.
• These assets must be inventoried and assessed for the level of protection needed to thwart 
potential attacks.
• Asset management consists of inventorying all assets, and then developing and 
implementing policies and procedures to protect them.
• This task can be daunting considering many organizations must protect internal users and 
resources, mobile workers, and cloud-based and virtual services.
• Further, organizations need to identify where critical information assets are stored, and how 
access is gained to that information. 
• Information assets vary, as do the threats against them. Each of these assets can attract 
different threat actors who have different skill levels and motivations.

12
© 2020 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Understanding Defense
Identify Vulnerabilities
• Threat identification provides an organization with a list of likely threats for a particular 
environment. 
• When identifying threats, it is important to ask several questions:
• What are the possible vulnerabilities of a system?
• Who may want to exploit those vulnerabilities to access specific information assets?
• What are the consequences if system vulnerabilities are exploited and assets are lost?

Identify Vulnerabilities (Contd.)
The threat identification for an e-banking 
system would include:
• Internal system compromise - The 
attacker uses the exposed e-banking 
servers to break into an internal bank 
system.
• Stolen customer data - An attacker 
steals the personal and financial data of 
bank customers from the customer 
database.
• Phony transactions from an external 
server - An attacker alters the code of 
the e-banking application and makes 
transactions by impersonating a 
legitimate user.

14

Understanding Defense
Identify Vulnerabilities (Contd.)
•
Phony transactions using a stolen 
customer PIN or smart card - An 
attacker steals the identity of a 
customer and completes malicious 
transactions from the compromised 
account.
•
Data input errors - A user inputs 
incorrect data or makes incorrect 
transaction requests.
•
Data center destruction - A 
cataclysmic event severely damages or 
destroys the data center.
•
Identifying vulnerabilities on a network requires an understanding of the important 
applications used as well as the different vulnerabilities of that application and hardware. This 
requires a significant amount of research on the part of the network administrator.

15
© 2020 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Understanding Defense
Identify Threats
• Organizations must use a defense-in-depth approach to identify threats and secure 
vulnerable assets.
• This approach uses multiple layers of security at the network edge, within the network, and 
on network endpoints.
• In this approach, a router first screens the traffic before forwarding it to a dedicated firewall 
appliance, for example, the Cisco ASA.
• Routers and firewalls are not the only devices that are used in a defense-in-depth approach.
• Other security devices include Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), advanced malware 
protection (AMP), web and email content security systems, identity services, network access 
controls and more.
• In the layered defense-in-depth security approach, the different layers work together to create 
a security architecture in which the failure of one safeguard does not affect the effectiveness 
of the other safeguards.

Understanding Defense
Identify Threats (Contd.)
• The figure displays a simple topology of a defense-in-depth approach:
• Edge router - The first line of defense is known as an edge router (R1 in the figure). The 
edge router has a set of rules specifying which traffic it allows or denies. It passes all 
connections that are intended for the internal LAN to the firewall.
• Firewall - A second line of defense is the firewall. The firewall is a checkpoint device that 
performs additional filtering and tracks the state of the connections. It denies the initiation 
of connections from the untrusted networks to the trusted network while enabling internal 
users to establish two-way connections to the untrusted networks.
• Internal router - Another line of defense is the internal router (R2 in the figure). It can 
apply final filtering rules on the traffic before it is forwarded to its destination.

The Security Onion and The Security Artichoke
There are two common analogies that are used to describe a defense-in-depth approach.
Security Onion
•
A common analogy used to describe 
a defense-in-depth approach is 
called "the security onion."
•
As illustrated in figure, a threat actor 
would have to peel away at a 
network’s defenses layer by layer in 
a manner similar to peeling an 
onion.
•
Only after penetrating each layer 
would the threat actor reach the 
target data or system.
Note: The security onion described on this page is a way of visualizing defense-in-depth. This 
is not to be confused with the Security Onion suite of network security tools.

18

Understanding Defense
The Security Onion and The Security Artichoke (Contd.)
Security Artichoke
• The evolution of borderless networks has changed the 
analogy to the "security artichoke", which benefits the 
threat actor.
• As illustrated in the figure, threat actors no longer 
have to peel away each layer. They only need to 
remove certain "artichoke leaves."
• The bonus is that each "leaf" of the network may 
reveal sensitive data that is not well secured.
• In order to get at the heart of the artichoke, the hacker 
chips away at the security armor along the perimeter.
• While internet-facing systems are very well protected, 
persistent hackers do find a gap in that hard-core 
exterior through which they can enter.

Security Policies, Regulations, and Standards
Business Policies
• Business policies are the guidelines that are developed by an organization to govern its 
actions.
• The policies define standards of correct behavior for the business and its employees.
• In networking, policies define the activities that are allowed on the network.
• This sets a baseline of acceptable use. If behavior that violates business policy is detected on 
the network, it is possible that a security breach has occurred.

21

Security Policies, Regulations, and Standards
Business Policies (Contd.)
An organization may have several guiding policies, as listed in the table.
Policy
Description
Company
policies
• It establishes the rules of conduct and the responsibilities of both employees and employers.
• It protect the rights of workers as well as the business interests of employers.
• Depending on the needs of the organization, various policies and procedures establish rules 
regarding employee conduct, attendance, dress code, privacy and other areas related to the 
terms and conditions of employment.
Employee
policies
• These policies are created and maintained by human resources staff to identify employee 
salary, pay schedule, employee benefits, work schedule, vacations, and more.
• They are often provided to new employees to review and sign.
Security
policies
• These policies identify a set of security objectives for a company, define the rules of behavior 
for users and administrators, and specify system requirements.
• These objectives, rules, and requirements collectively ensure the security of a network and 
the computer systems in an organization.
• It is a constantly evolving document based on changes in the threat landscape, 
vulnerabilities, and business and employee requirements.

Security Policies, Regulations, and Standards
Security Policy
• Security policies are used to inform users, staff, and managers of an organization’s 
requirements for protecting technology and information assets.
• A comprehensive security policy has a number of benefits, including the following:
• Demonstrates an organization’s commitment to security
• Sets the rules for expected behavior
• Ensures consistency in system operations, software and hardware acquisition and use, and 
maintenance
• Defines the legal consequences of violations
• Gives security staff the backing of management
• A security policy also specifies the mechanisms that are needed to meet security 
requirements and provides a baseline from which to acquire, configure, and audit computer 
systems and networks for compliance.

BYOD Policies 
• Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) enables employees to use their own mobile devices to 
access company systems, software, networks, or information.
• It provides key benefits to enterprises, including increased productivity, reduced costs, better 
mobility for employees, and so on. These benefits also bring an increased security risk as 
BYOD can lead to data breaches and greater liability for the organization. 
• Therefore, a BYOD security policy should be developed to accomplish the following:
• Specify the goals of the BYOD program
• Identify which employees can bring their own devices
• Identify which devices will be supported
• Identify the level of access employees are granted when using personal devices
• Describe the rights to access and activities permitted to security personnel on the device
• Identify which regulations must be adhered to when using employee devices
• Identify safeguards to put in place if a device is compromised

Understanding Defense Summary
What Did I Learn in this Module?
•
The starting point for network defense is the identification of assets, vulnerabilities, and 
threats.
•
Assets are anything of value to an organization that must be protected including servers, 
infrastructure devices, end devices, and the greatest asset, data.
•
Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in a system or its design that could be exploited by a threat 
actor. 
•
Threats are any potential danger to an asset.
•
Organizations must use a defense-in-depth approach to identify threats and secure 
vulnerable assets.
•
Organizations must have a set of policies that define the activities that are allowed on the 
network.
•
Business policies define standards of correct behavior for the business and its employees.

Understanding Defense Summary
What Did I Learn in this Module? (Contd.)
•
Security policies are used to inform users, staff, and managers of an organization’s 
requirements for protecting technology and information assets.
•
The purpose of a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policy is to enable employees to use their 
own mobile devices to access company systems, software, networks, or information. 
•
The compliance regulations that an organization is obligated to follow depend on the type of 
organization and the data that the organization handles.

19.1 Access Control Concepts

11
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Access Control
Communications Security: CIA
Information security deals with protecting information and 
information systems from unauthorized access, use, 
disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
CIA Triad
The CIA triad consists of three components of information 
security:
• Confidentiality - Only authorized individuals, entities, 
or processes can access sensitive information.
• Integrity - This refers to the protection of data from 
unauthorized alteration.
• Availability - Authorized users must have uninterrupted 
access to the network resources and data that they 
require.

12

Access Control
Zero Trust Security
• Zero trust is a comprehensive approach to securing all access across networks, applications, 
and environments.
• This approach helps secure access from users, end-user devices, APIs, IoT, microservices, 
containers, and more.
• The principle of a zero trust approach is "never trust always verify".
• A zero trust security framework helps to prevent unauthorized access, contain breaches, and 
reduce the risk of an attacker's lateral movement through a network.
• In a Zero trust approach, any place at which an access control decision is required should be 
considered a perimeter.

13
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Access Control
Zero Trust Security (Contd.)
The three pillars of zero trust are workforce, workloads, and workplace.
• Zero Trust for the Workforce - This pillar consists of people who access work applications 
by using their personal or corporate-managed devices. It ensures only the right users and 
secure devices can access applications, regardless of location. 
• Zero Trust for Workloads - This pillar is concerned with applications that are running in the 
cloud, in data centers, and other virtualized environments that interact with one another. It 
focuses on secure access when an API, a microservice, or a container is accessing a 
database within an application. 
• Zero Trust for the Workplace - This pillar focuses on secure access for all devices, 
including on the internet of things (IoT), that connect to enterprise networks, such as user 
endpoints, physical and virtual servers, printers, cameras and more.

Access Control
Access Control Models
• An organization must implement proper access controls to protect its network resources, 
information system resources, and information.
• A security analyst should understand the different basic access control models to have a 
better understanding of how attackers can break the access controls.
• The following table lists various types of access control models:
Access Control Models
Description
Discretionary access control (DAC)
•
This is the least restrictive model and allows users to control 
access to their data as owners of that data.
•
It may use ACLs or other methods to specify which users or 
groups of users have access to the information.
Mandatory access control (MAC)
•
This applies the strictest access control and is used in 
military or mission critical applications.
•
It assigns security level labels to information and enables 
users with access based on their security level clearance.

15
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
Access Control
Access Control Models (Contd.)
Access Control Models
Description
Role-based access control (RBAC)
• Access decisions are based on an individual’s roles and 
responsibilities within the organization. 
• Different roles are assigned security privileges, and individuals 
are assigned to the RBAC profile for the role. 
• Also known as a type of non-discretionary access control.
Attribute-based access control (ABAC) 
It allows access based on attributes of the object to be accessed, 
the subject accessing the resource, and environmental factors 
regarding how the object is to be accessed.
Rule-based access control (RBAC)
• Network security staff specify sets of rules or conditions that 
are associated with access to data or systems. 
• These rules may specify permitted or denied IP addresses, or 
certain protocols and other conditions. 
• Also known as Rule Based RBAC.
Time-based access control (TAC)
It allows access to network resources based on time and day.

19.2 AAA Usage and Operation

17
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
AAA Usage and Operation
AAA Operation
• A network must be designed to control who is allowed to connect to it and what they are 
allowed to do when they are connected. These design requirements are identified in the 
network security policy.
• The policy specifies how network administrators, corporate users, remote users, business 
partners, and clients access network resources.
• The network security policy can also mandate the implementation of an accounting system 
that tracks who logged in and when and what they did while logged in. 
• The Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) protocol provides the necessary 
framework to enable scalable access security. 

18
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
AAA Usage and Operation
AAA Operation (Contd.)
The following table lists the three independent security functions provided by the AAA 
architectural framework:
AAA Component
Description
Authentication
•
Authentication can be established using username and password combinations, 
challenge and response questions, token cards, and other methods.
•
AAA authentication provides a centralized way to control access to the network.
Authorization
•
After the user is authenticated, authorization services determine which resources 
the user can access and which operations the user is allowed to perform.
•
An example is "User can access host server XYZ using SSH only."
Accounting
•
Accounting records what the user does, including what is accessed, the amount of 
time the resource is accessed, and any changes that were made.
•
Accounting keeps track of how network resources are used.
•
An example is "User accessed host server XYZ using SSH for 15 minutes."

19

AAA Usage and Operation
AAA Operation (Contd.)
This concept is similar to the use 
of a credit card, as indicated by 
the figure. The credit card 
identifies who can use it, how 
much that user can spend, and 
keeps account of what items the 
user spent money on.

20
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
AAA Usage and Operation
AAA Authentication
• AAA Authentication can be used to authenticate users for administrative access or it can 
be used to authenticate users for remote network access.
• Cisco provides two common methods for implementing AAA Services:
Local AAA Authentication
• This method is known as self-contained authentication because it authenticates users 
against locally stored usernames and passwords. 
• Local AAA is ideal for small networks.

21
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
AAA Usage and Operation
AAA Authentication (Contd.)
• The client establishes a connection with the router.
• The AAA router prompts the user for a username and password.
• The router authenticated the username and password using the local database and the 
user is provided access to the network based on information in the local database.

22
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
AAA Usage and Operation
AAA Authentication (Contd.)
Server-based AAA Authentication
• This method authenticates against a central AAA server that contains the usernames and 
passwords for all users. This is ideal for medium-to-large networks.
• The client establishes a connection with the router.
• The AAA router prompts the user for a username and password.
• The router authenticates the username and password using a AAA server.
• The user is provided access to the network based on information in the remote AAA server.

23

AAA Usage and Operation
AAA Authentication (Contd.)
Centralized AAA
• Centralized AAA is more scalable and manageable than local AAA authentication, and 
therefore, it is the preferred AAA implementation.
• A centralized AAA system may independently maintain databases for authentication, 
authorization, and accounting. 
• It can leverage Active Directory or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for user 
authentication and group membership, while maintaining its own authorization and 
accounting databases.
• Devices communicate with the centralized AAA server using either the Remote 
Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) or Terminal Access Controller Access Control 
System (TACACS+) protocols.

24

AAA Usage and Operation
AAA Authentication (Contd.)
The following table lists the differences between the two protocols:
Functions
TACACS+
RADIUS
Functionality
It separates authentication, authorization, 
and accounting functions according to the 
AAA architecture. This allows modularity 
of the security server implementation.
It combines authentication and authorization 
but separates accounting, which allows less 
flexibility in implementation than TACACS+.
Standard
Mostly Cisco supported
Open/RFC standard
Transport 
TCP port 49
UDP ports 1812 and 1813, or 1645 and 1646
Protocol CHAP
Bidirectional challenge and response as 
used in Challenge Handshake 
Authentication Protocol (CHAP)
Unidirectional challenge and response from 
the RADIUS security server to the RADIUS 
client

AAA Usage and Operation
AAA Authentication (Contd.)
Functions
TACACS+
RADIUS
Confidentiality
Encrypts the entire body of the packet 
but leaves a standard TACACS+ 
header.
Encrypts only the password in the access-
request packet from the client to the server. 
The remainder of the packet is unencrypted, 
leaving the username, authorized services, and 
accounting unprotected.
Customization
Provides authorization of router 
commands on a per-user or per-group 
basis.
Has no option to authorize router commands on 
a per-user or per-group basis.
Accounting

AAA Usage and Operation
AAA Accounting Logs
• Centralized AAA also enables the use of the Accounting method. 
• Accounting records from all devices are sent to centralized repositories, which simplifies 
auditing of user actions.
• AAA Accounting collects and reports usage data in AAA logs. These logs are useful for 
security auditing. 
• The collected data might include the start and stop connection times, executed commands, 
number of packets, and number of bytes.
• One widely deployed use of accounting is to combine it with AAA authentication. This helps 
with managing access to internetworking devices by network administrative staff.

27
© 2020  Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.   Cisco Confidential
AAA Usage and Operation
AAA Accounting Logs (Contd.)
• Accounting provides more security than just authentication. The AAA servers keep a detailed 
log of exactly what the authenticated user does on the device. 
• This includes all EXEC and configuration commands issued by the user.
• When a user has been authenticated, the AAA accounting process generates a start 
message to begin the accounting process.
• When the user finishes, a stop message is recorded and the accounting process ends.

28

AAA Usage and Operation
AAA Accounting Logs (Contd.)
The following table describes the types of accounting information that can be collected:
Types of Accounting 
Information
Description
Network Accounting
It captures information for all Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) sessions, including 
packet and byte counts.
Connection Accounting It captures information about all outbound connections that are made from the AAA 
client, such as by SSH.
EXEC Accounting
It captures information about user EXEC terminal sessions on the network access 
server, including username, date, start and stop times, and the access server IP 
address.
System Accounting
It captures information about all system-level events.
Command Accounting
It captures information about the EXEC shell commands for a specified privilege 
level ,as well as the date and time each command was executed, and the user who 
executed it.
Resource Accounting
It captures 'start' and 'stop' record support for connections that have passed user 
authentication.

High Availability
The Five Nines
What is Five Nine?
Five nines mean that systems and services are available 99.999% of the 
time. It also means that both planned and unplanned downtime is less than 
5.26 minutes per year. High availability refers to a system or component 
that is continuously operational for a given length of time. To help ensure 
high availability:
Eliminate single points of failure
Design for reliability
Detect failures as they occur

Environments That Require Five Nines
Although the cost of sustaining high availability may be too 
costly for some industries, several environments require 
five nines.
The finance industry needs to main high availability for 
continuous trading, compliance, and customer trust. 
Healthcare facilities require high availability to provide 
around-the-clock care for patients. 
The public safety industry includes agencies that provide 
security and services to a community, state, or nation. 
The retail industry depends on efficient supply chains 
and the delivery of products to customers. Disruption 
can be devastating, especially during peak demand 
times such as holidays.

Threats to Availability
There are many different types of threats to high 
availability, the threats can range from failure of a mission-
critical application to severe storm such as a hurricane or 
tornado. Threats can also include catastrophic event such 
as a terrorist attack, building bombing, or building fires.
Designing a High Availability System
High availability incorporates three major principles to 
achieve the goal of uninterrupted access to data and 
services:
Elimination or reduction of single-points of failure
System Resiliency
Fault Tolerance

Measures to Improve Availability
Asset Management
An organization needs to know what hardware and software assets they have in 
order to protect them. Asset management includes a complete inventory of 
hardware and software. This means that the organization needs to know all of 
components that can be subject to security risks, including:
•
Every hardware system
•
Every operating system
•
Every hardware network device
•
Every network device operating system
•
Every software application
•
All firmware
•
All language runtime environments
•
All individual libraries
Many organizations may choose an automated solution to keep track of assets.

Measures to Improve Availability
Asset Management (Cont.)
Asset classification - assigns all resources of an organization into a group 
based on common characteristics. An organization should apply an asset 
classification system to documents, data records, data files, and disks. 
Asset Standardization - as part of an IT asset management system, an 
organization specifies the acceptable IT assets that meet its objectives
Threat Identification - The United States Computer Emergency Readiness 
Team (US-CERT) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security sponsor a 
dictionary of common vulnerabilities and exposure (CVE). The CVE identification 
contains a standard identifier number with a brief description, and references to 
related vulnerability reports and advisories. 
Risk Analysis - is the process of analyzing the dangers posed by natural and 
human-caused events to the assets of an organization. A user performs an asset 
identification to help determine which assets to protect. 
Mitigation - Mitigation involves reducing the severity of the loss or the likelihood 
of the loss from occurring. Many technical controls mitigate risk including 
authentication systems, file permissions, and firewalls.

Measures to Improve Availability
Defense in Depth
Defense in depth will not provide an impenetrable cyber shield, but it will help an 
organization minimize risk by keeping it one step ahead of cyber criminals. To 
make sure data and information remains available, an organization must create 
different layers of protection:
A layered approach provides the most comprehensive protection. If cyber 
criminals penetrate one layer, they still have to contend with several more layers 
with each layer being more complicated than the previous one. Layering is 
creating a barrier of multiple defenses that coordinate together to prevent 
attacks. 
Limiting access to data and information reduces the possibility of a threat. An 
organization should restrict access so that users only have the level of access 
required to do their job.

Measures to Improve Availability
Defense in Depth
Diversity refers to changing the controls 
and procedures at different layers. 
Breaching one layer of security does not 
compromise the whole system. An 
organization may use different encryption 
algorithms or authentication systems to 
protect data in different states.
Obscuring information can also protect data 
and information. An organization should not 
reveal any information that cyber criminals 
can use to figure out what version of the 
operating system a server is running or the 
type of equipment it uses. 
Complexity does not necessarily guarantee 
security. If the process or technology are too 
complex, misconfigurations or failure to 
comply can result. Simplicity can actually 
improve availability.

Measures to Improve Availability
Redundancy
A single point of failure must be identified and 
addressed. A single point of failure can be a 
specific piece of hardware, a process, a specific 
piece of data, or even an essential utility. 
• Single points of failure are the weak links in the 
chain that can cause disruption of the 
organization's operations. 
• Generally, the solution to a single point of failure 
is to modify the critical operation so that it does 
not rely on a single element. 
• The organization can also build redundant 
components into the critical operation to take 
over the process should one of these points fail.

Measures to Improve Availability
Redundancy (Cont.)
N+1 redundancy ensures system availability in the event of a component 
failure. 
Components (N) need to have at least one backup component (+1). 
For example, a car has four tires (N) and a spare tire in the trunk in case of a 
flat (+1).

Measures to Improve Availability
Redundancy (Cont.)
A redundant array of independent disks (RAID) combines multiple physical 
hard drives into a single logical unit to provide data redundancy and improve 
performance. 
RAID takes data that is normally stored on a single disk and spreads it out 
among several drives. If any single disk is lost, the user can recover data from 
the other disks where the data also resides.
RAID can also increase the speed of data recovery. 
Using multiple drives makes retrieving requested data faster, instead of relying 
on just one disk to do the work.
A RAID solution can be either hardware-based or software-based. The 
following terms describe how RAID stores data on the various disks:
•
Parity - Detects data errors.
•
Striping - Writes data across multiple drives.
•
Mirroring - Stores duplicate data on a second drive.

Redundancy (Cont.)
Spanning Tree is a network protocol that provides for redundancy: 
The basic function of STP is to prevent loops on a network when switches 
interconnect via multiple paths. 
STP ensures that redundant physical links are loop-free. It ensures that there 
is only one logical path between all destinations on the network. 
STP intentionally blocks redundant paths that could cause a loop.

Redundancy (Cont.)
The default gateway is typically the router that provides devices access to the 
rest of the network or to the Internet. If there is only one router serving as the 
default gateway, it is a single point of failure. Router redundancy involves:
Choosing to install an additional standby router.
The ability of a network to dynamically recover from the failure of a router 
acting as a default gateway is known as first-hop redundancy.

Redundancy (Cont.)
Router Redundancy Options - options available for router redundancy include:
Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) - HSRP provides high network 
availability by providing first-hop routing redundancy. 
Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) - A VRRP router runs the 
VRRP protocol in conjunction with one or more other routers attached to a 
LAN. In a VRRP configuration, the elected router is the virtual router master, 
and the other routers act as backups, in case the virtual router master fails.
Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) - GLBP protects data traffic from 
a failed router or circuit, like HSRP and VRRP, while also allowing load 
balancing (also called load sharing) between a group of redundant routers.

Redundancy (Cont.)
Location Redundancy - An organization may need to consider location 
redundancy depending on its needs. The following outlines three forms of 
location redundancy:
Synchronous - Synchronizes both locations in real time, requires high 
bandwidth and locations must be close together to reduce latency.
Asynchronous Replication - Not synchronized in real time but close to it, 
requires less bandwidth and sites can be further apart because latency is less 
of an issue.
Point-in-time-Replication - Updates the backup data location periodically and 
is the most bandwidth conservative option because it does not require a 
constant connection.

System Resilience
Resiliency defines the methods and configurations used to make a system or 
network tolerant of failure. Routing protocols provide resiliency. Resilient design 
is more than just adding redundancy. Resiliency is critical to understand the 
business needs of the organization, and then incorporate redundancy to create a 
resilient network.

Incident Response
Incident Response Phases
Incident response defines the procedures that an organization follows after an 
event occurs outside the normal range. When an incident occurs, the 
organization must know how to respond. Organizations needs to develop an 
incident response plan and put together a Computer Security Incident 
Response Team (CSIRT) to manage the response. Incident response has 
consist of four phases:
1. Preparation – planning for potential incidents
2. Detection and Analysis - discovering the incident
3. Containment and Eradication, and Recovery - efforts to immediately 
contain or eradicate the threat and begin recovery efforts
4. Post-Incident Follow-Up – investigate the cause of the incident and ask 
questions to better understand the nature of the threat

Incident Response
Incident Response Technologies
There are many technologies that are used to implement an incident 
response:
Network Admission Control (NAC) - allows network access for authorized 
users with compliant systems. A compliant system meets all of the policy 
requirements of the organization. 
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) - monitor the traffic on a network. IDS 
systems are passive. 
Intrusion Prevention Systems - operates in inline mode. It can detect and 
immediately address a network problem.
NetFlow and IPFIX - NetFlow is a Cisco IOS technology that provides 
statistics on packets flowing through a Cisco router or multilayer switch. 
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) used Cisco’s NetFlow Version 
9 as the basis for IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX).
Advanced Threat Intelligence - can help organizations detect attacks 
during one of the stages of the cyberattack (and sometimes before with the 
right information).

Disaster Recovery
Disaster Recovery Planning
Types of Disasters - It is critical to keep an organization functioning when a 
disaster occurs. A disaster includes any natural or human-caused event that 
damages assets or property and impairs the ability for the organization to 
continue operating.
Natural Disasters - geological disasters (earthquakes, landslides, 
volcanoes, and tsunamis), meteorological disasters (hurricanes, tornadoes, 
snow storms, lightning, and hail), health disasters (widespread illnesses, 
quarantines, and pandemics) and miscellaneous disasters (fires, floods, 
solar storms, and avalanches).
Human-caused Disasters - Human-caused disasters - labor events 
(strikes, walkouts, and slowdowns), social-political events (vandalism, 
blockades, protests, sabotage, terrorism, and war), materials events 
(hazardous spills and fires) and utilities disruptions (power failures, 
communication outages, fuel shortages, and radioactive fallout)

Disaster Recovery
Business Continuity Planning
Need for Business Continuity - Business continuity is one of the most 
important concepts in computer security. Even though companies do 
whatever they can to prevent disasters and loss of data, it is impossible to 
predict every scenario. It is important for companies to have plans in place 
that ensure business continuity regardless of what may occur. 
Business Continuity Considerations - Business continuity controls are 
more than just backing up data and providing redundant hardware. 
Business Continuity Considerations should include: 
Documenting configurations
Establishing alternate communications channels 
Providing power
Identifying all dependencies for applications and processes 
Understanding how to carry out automated tasks manually

Host Hardening
Operating System Security - The operating system plays a critical role in the 
operation of a computer system and is the target of many attacks. 
An administrator hardens an operating system by modifying the default 
configuration to make it more secure to outside threats. 
This process includes the removal of unnecessary programs and services. 
Another critical requirement of hardening operating systems is the application 
of security patches and updates. 
Antimalware - Malware includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, keyloggers, 
spyware, and adware. 
They all invade privacy, steal information, damage the system, or delete and 
corrupt data. 
It is important to protect computers and mobile devices using reputable 
antimalware software.

Host Hardening (Cont.)
Patch Management - Patches are code updates that manufacturers provide to 
prevent a newly discovered virus or worm from making a successful attack. 
Manufacturers combine patches and upgrades into a comprehensive update 
application called a service pack. 
Host-based Firewalls - A software firewall is a program that runs on a 
computer to allow or deny traffic between the computer and other connected 
computers. The software firewall applies a set of rules to data transmissions 
through inspection and filtering of data packets. 
Host Intrusion Detection Systems - A host intrusion detection system (HIDS) 
is software that runs on a host computer that monitors suspicious activity. 
Secure Communications (VPNs) - When connecting to the local network and 
sharing files, the communication between computers remains within that 
network. To communicate and share resources over a network that is not 
secure, users employ a Virtual Private Network (VPN). A VPN is a private 
network that connects remote sites or users together over a public network, like 
the Internet.

Hardening Wireless and Mobile Devices
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) - One of the most important components of 
modern computing are mobile devices. The majority of devices found on today’s 
networks are laptops, tablets, smart phones and other wireless devices. WEP is 
one of the first widely used Wi-Fi security standards. The WEP standard 
provides authentication and encryption protections.
WPA/WPA2 - The next major improvement to wireless security was the 
introduction of WPA and WPA2. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) was the 
computer industry’s response to the weakness of the WEP standard. The WPA 
standard provided several security improvements.
Mutual Authentication - The imposter can launch a man-in-the-middle attack 
which is very difficult to detect and can result in stolen login credentials and 
transmitted data. To prevent rogue access points, the computer industry 
developed mutual authentication. Mutual authentication, also called two-way 
authentication, is a process or technology in which both entities in a 
communications link authenticate to each other.

Host Data Protection
File Access Control – This consists of permissions that limit folder or file 
access for an individual or for a group of users. 
File Encryption – File encryption is a tool used to protect data stored in the 
form of files. Encryption transforms data using a complicated algorithm to make 
it unreadable. Software programs can encrypt files, folders, and even entire 
drives.
System and Data Backups - A data backup stores a copy of the information 
from a computer to removable backup media. Backing up data is one of the 
most effective ways of protecting against data loss. If the computer hardware 
fails, the user can restore the data from the backup after the system is again 
functional.

Images and Content Control
Content Screening and Blocking 
Content control software restricts the content that a user can access with a web 
browser over the Internet. 
Content control software can block sites that contain certain types of material 
such as pornography or controversial religious or political content. 
Disk Cloning and Deep Freeze
Many third-party applications are available to restore a system back to a 
default state. This allows the administrator to protect the operating system 
and configuration files for a system.
Disk cloning copies the contents of the computer’s hard disk to an image file. 
Deep Freeze “freezes” the hard drive partition. When a user restarts the 
system, the system reverts to its frozen configuration. The system does not 
save any changes that the user makes, so any applications installed or files 
saved are lost when the system restarts.

Physical Protection and Workstations
Security Cables and Locks - There are several methods of physically 
protecting computer equipment:
Use cable locks 
Keep telecommunication rooms locked.
Use security cages around equipment.
Logout Timers - An employee gets up and leaves his computer to take a break. 
If the employee does not take any action to secure his workstation, any 
information on that system is vulnerable to an unauthorized user. 
Idle Timeout and Screen Lock - Employees may or may not log out of their 
computer when they leave the workplace. Therefore, it is a security best practice 
to configure an idle timer that will automatically log the user out and lock the 
screen. 
Login Times - In some situations, an organization may want employees to log 
in during specific hours, such as 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. The system blocks logins 
during the hours that fall outside of the allowed login hours.

real-time position tracking. GPS tracking can pinpoint a location within 100 
meters. 
Inventory and RFID Tags - Radio frequency identification (RFID) uses radio 
waves to identify and track objects. RFID inventory systems use tags attached

Managing Remote Access - Remote access refers to any combination of 
hardware and software that enables users to access a local internal network 
remotely.
Telnet, SSH, and SCP - Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol that provides a secure 
(encrypted) management connection to a remote device. 
SSH should replace Telnet for management connections. 
Telnet is an older protocol that uses unsecure plaintext transmission of both 
the login authentication (username and password) and the data transmitted 
between the communicating devices. 
Secure copy (SCP) securely transfers computer files between two remote 
systems. SCP uses SSH for data transfer (including the authentication 
element), so SCP ensures the authenticity and confidentiality of the data in 
transit.

they need. An administrator should look at every service to verify its necessity and 
evaluate its risk. Remove any unnecessary services.
Privileged Accounts - Cyber criminals exploit privileged accounts because they 
are the most powerful accounts in the organization. Privileged accounts have the 
credentials to gain access to systems and they provide elevated, unrestricted 
access. Administrators use these accounts to deploy and manage operating 
systems, applications, and network devices. These account should be secured or 
removed to mitigate these risks.
Group Policies - In most networks that use Windows computers, an administrator 
configures Active Directory with Domains on a Windows Server. An administrator 
configures user account policies such as password policies and lockout policies by 
adding users to groups and setting policy at a group level.
Enable Logs and Alerts - A log records events as they occur on  a system. Log 
entries make up a log file, and a log entry contains all of the information related to 
a specific event. Logs that relate to computer security have grown in importance.

Server Hardening
Physical Protection of Server
Power - A critical issue in protecting information systems is electrical power 
systems and power considerations. A continuous supply of electrical power is 
critical in today's massive server and data storage facilities. 
Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) - HVAC systems are 
critical to the safety of people and information systems in the organization's 
facilities. When designing modern IT facilities, these systems play a very 
important role in the overall security. HVAC systems control the ambient 
environment (temperature, humidity, airflow, and air filtering) and must be 
planned for and operated along with other data center components such as 
computing hardware, cabling, data storage, fire protection, physical security 
systems and power.
Hardware Monitoring - Hardware monitoring is often found in large server 
farms. A server farm is a facility that houses hundreds or thousands of servers 
for companies.

Network Hardening
Securing Network Devices 
Operation Centers - The Network Operation Center (NOC) is one or more 
locations containing the tools that provide administrators with a detailed status of 
the organization’s network. The NOC is ground zero for network troubleshooting, 
performance monitoring, software distribution and updates, communications 
management, and device management.
Switches, Routers, and Network Appliances - Network devices ship with 
either no passwords or default passwords. 
Network switches are the heart of the modern data communication network. 
The main threat to network switches are theft, hacking and remote access, 
attacks against network protocols like ARP/STP or attacks against 
performance and availability.
VLANs - provide a way to group devices within a LAN and on individual 
switches. VLANs use logical connections instead of physical connections.

Network Hardening
Securing Network Devices (Cont.)
Firewalls - are hardware or software solutions that enforce network security 
policies. A firewall filters unauthorized or potentially dangerous traffic from 
entering the network.
Routers - Routers form the backbone of the Internet and communications 
between different networks. Routers communicate with one another to identify 
the best possible path to deliver traffic to different networks. Routers use 
routing protocols to make routing decision.
Wireless and Mobile Devices - Wireless and mobile devices have become 
the predominant type of devices on most modern networks. They provide 
mobility and convenience but pose a host of vulnerabilities. These 
vulnerabilities include theft, hacking and unauthorized remote access, sniffing, 
man-in-the-middle attacks, and attacks against performance and availability. 
Network and Routing Services - Cyber criminals use vulnerable network 
services to attack a device or to use it as part of the attack. Securing network 
services ensures that only necessary ports are exposed and available. 
Network services include; DHCP, DNS, ICMP, Routing Services (RIP-OSPF-
ISS), NTP and others.

Voice and Video Equipment
VoIP Equipment - uses networks such as the Internet to make and receive 
phone calls. The equipment required for VoIP includes an Internet connection 
plus a phone. 
Cameras - An Internet camera sends and receives data over a LAN and/or 
the Internet. A user can remotely view live video using a web browser on a 
wide range of devices including computer systems, laptops, tablets, and 
smartphones. Cameras come in various forms including the traditional 
security camera. 
Videoconferencing Equipment - allows two or more locations to 
communicate simultaneously using telecommunication technologies. These 
technologies take advantage of the new high definition video standards. 
Videoconferencing is now part of normal day-to-day operations in industries 
like the medical field. 
Network and IoT Sensors - One of the fastest sectors of information 
technology is the use of intelligent devices and sensors. The computer 
industry brands this sector as the Internet of Things (IoT). Businesses and 
consumers use IoT devices to automate processes, monitor environmental 
conditions, and alert the user of adverse conditions.

Physical Security
Physical Access Control
Fencing and Barricades - Physical barriers are the first thing that comes to 
mind when thinking about physical security. This is the outermost layer of 
security, and these solutions are the most publicly visible. A perimeter security 
system typically consists of perimeter fence system, security gate system, 
bollards, vehicle entry barriers and guard shelters.
Biometrics - are the automated methods of recognizing an individual based on 
a physiological or behavioral characteristic. Biometric authentication systems 
include measurements of the face, fingerprint, hand geometry, iris, retina, 
signature, and voice. Biometric technologies can be the foundation of highly 
secure identification and personal verification solutions.
Badges and Access Logs – A badge allows an individual to gain access to an 
area with automated entry points. An entry point can be a door, a turnstile, a 
gate, or other barrier. Access badges use various technologies such as a 
magnetic stripe, barcode, or biometrics. The system logs the transaction for 
later retrieval. Reports reveal who entered what entry points at what time.

Physical Security
Surveillance
Guards and Escorts - All physical access controls including deterrent and 
detection systems ultimately rely on personnel to intervene and stop the 
actual attack or intrusion. In highly secure information system facilities, guards 
control access to the organization’s sensitive areas.
Video and Electronic Surveillance – This type of surveillance can 
supplement or in some cases, replace security guards. The benefit of video 
and electronic surveillance is the ability to monitor areas even when no guards 
or personnel are present, the ability to record and log surveillance videos and 
data for long periods, and the ability to incorporate motion detection and 
notification.
RFID and Wireless Surveillance – These types of surveillance are used to 
manage and locate important information system assets.

Understanding the Ethics of Working in Cybersecurity
Ethics and Guiding Principles
Ethics of a Cybersecurity Specialist
Ethics is the little voice in the background guiding a cybersecurity specialist 
as to what he should or should not do, regardless of whether it is legal. The 
organization entrusts the cybersecurity specialist with the most sensitive data 
and resources. The cybersecurity specialist needs to understand how the law 
and the organization’s interests help to guide ethical decisions.
Computer Ethics Institute
The Computer Ethics Institute is a resource for identifying, assessing, and 
responding to ethical issues throughout the information technology industry. 
CEI was one of the first organizations to recognize the ethical and public 
policy issues arising from the rapid growth of the information technology field.

Cyber Laws and Liability
Cybercrime
Laws prohibit undesired behaviors. Unfortunately, the advancements in 
information system technologies are much faster than the legal system can 
accommodate. A number of laws and regulations affect cyberspace. 
Cybercrime
A computer may be involved in a cybercrime in a couple of different ways. There 
is computer-assisted crime, computer-targeted crime, and computer-incidental 
crime. Child pornography is an example of computer-incidental crime; the 
computer is a storage device and is not the actual tool used to commit the crime.
Organizations Created to Fight Cybercrime
There are a number of agencies and organizations out there to aid the fight 
against cybercrime.

National Vulnerability Database (NVD) - is a U.S. government repository of 
standards-based vulnerability management data that uses the Security Content 
Automation Protocol (SCAP). 
CERT - The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University 
helps government and industry organizations to develop, operate, and maintain 
software systems that are innovative, affordable, and trustworthy. It is a 
Federally Funded Research and Development Center sponsored by the U.S. 
Department of Defense.
Internet Storm Center - provides a free analysis and warning service to Internet 
users and organizations. It also works with Internet Service Providers to combat 
malicious cyber criminals. The Internet Storm Center gathers millions of log 
entries from intrusion detection systems every day using sensors covering 
500,000 IP addresses in over 50 countries. 
The Advanced Cyber Security Center (ACSC) - is a non-profit organization

Cybersecurity Weapons
Vulnerability Scanners - assess computers, computer systems, networks, or 
applications for weaknesses. Vulnerability scanners help to automate security 
auditing by scanning the network for security risks and producing a prioritized list 
to address weaknesses. 
Penetrating Testing (or pen testing) - is a method of testing the areas of 
weaknesses in systems by using various malicious techniques. Pen testing is 
not the same as vulnerability testing. Vulnerability testing just identifies potential 
problems. Pen testing involves a cybersecurity specialist who hacks a website, 
network, or server with the organization’s permission to try to gain access to 
resources without the knowledge of usernames, passwords, or other normal 
means. 
Packet Analyzers (or packet sniffers) - intercept and log network traffic. The 
packet analyzer captures each packet, shows the values of various fields in the 
packet, and analyzes its content. A sniffer can capture network traffic on both 
wired and wireless networks.
Security Tools - There is no one size fits all when it comes to the best security 
tools. Much depends on the situation, circumstance, and personal preference. A 
cybersecurity specialist must know where to go to get sound information.

Learn how to type commands

Basic Linux Command Syntax
●
What is a command?
○
A command is a software program that can be executed on the command line and 
performs an action on the computer.
●
To execute a command, type the command at the prompt:
(In the example above, the command ls was typed at the prompt sysadmin@localhost:~$.)
●
Most commands follow a simple pattern of syntax:
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls                                                        
Desktop
Documents
Downloads
Music
Pictures
Public
Templates
Videos
command [options…] [arguments…]

Basic Linux Command Syntax
●
What are arguments?
●
An argument can be used to specify something for the command to act upon.
●
For example, the ls command can be given the name of a directory as an 
argument and it will list the contents of that directory:
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls Documents                                                       
School           alpha-second.txt  food.txt     linux.txt     os.csv
Work             alpha-third.txt   hello.sh     longfile.txt  people.csv
...
command [options…] [arguments…]

Basic Linux Command Syntax
●
What are options?
●
Options can be used to alter the behavior of a command.
●
For example, the -l option can be used with the ls command to result in a 
“long display” output that provides more information about the directories:
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l                                                      
total 32                                                                        
drwx------ 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Dec 20  2017 Desktop
drwx------ 4 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Dec 20  2017 Documents
drwx------ 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Dec 20  2017 Downloads
...     
command [options…] [arguments…]

How to locate where you are in the filesystem

Printing the Working Directory
●
To find out where you are in the Linux filesystem, use the pwd (print working 
directory) command.
●
According to the output of the pwd command above, the user is in their home
folder in the filesystem.
⁠  
sysadmin@localhost:~$ pwd                                                      
/home/sysadmin                                                                   
Note
In the first prompt above, the blue ~ is equivalent to /home/sysadmin, representing the user's home directory.
After changing directories, the new location can also be confirmed in the new prompt, again shown in blue.
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents$

How to move to another directory in the filesystem

Changing Directories
●
Directories are a type of file used to store other files.
●
They provide a hierarchical structure:
⁠  

Changing Directories
●
To navigate the filesystem structure, use the cd command. Using a directory as an 
argument will change to that directory:
●
A path is a list of directories separated by the / character (i.e., /home/sysadmin).
●
Absolute paths specify the exact location of a directory beginning at the root (/) 
directory: /home/sysadmin
●
Relative paths give directions to a file relative to your current location (instead of the 
root directory): School/Art
⁠  
sysadmin@localhost:~$ cd Documents                                                   
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents$              

Changing Directories
●
Shortcuts can also be used to change directories. 
○
The .. characters always represents one (1) directory higher relative to your 
current directory, also known as the parent directory. 
○
The . character represents your current directory.
○
The ~ character represents the home directory of the current user. 
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents/School/Art$ cd ..           
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents/School$ 
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents/School/Art$ cd ~           
sysadmin@localhost:~$ 

Learn how to list files and file information 

Listing Files
●
The ls command is used to list the contents of a directory. 
●
Remember that when used with the -l option, the ls command will display 
more details about files:
●
The output includes information about file type, file permissions, file 
ownership, timestamps and more. 
⁠  
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l /var/log           
total 844

How to gain administrative access using the Linux command line

Administrative Access
●
Some commands provide sensitive information such as passwords and 
system information. 
●
Preventing regular users from executing these commands helps protect the 
system.
●
Logging in as the root user provides administrative access to execute these 
commands.  
⁠  

Administrative Access
●
The su command allows you to temporarily login as a different user by 
opening a new shell. 
●
su can be used to login as the root user, providing administrative privileges.
●
To login as the root user, execute the su command without specifying a user 
and type in the root password:  
●
To return to the regular user, use the exit command 
sysadmin@localhost:~$ su -
Password:
root@localhost:~$

Administrative Access
●
The sudo command allows a user to execute a command as another user 
without creating a new shell. 
●
To execute a command as root, type sudo before the command and provide 
the root password:  
⁠  
sysadmin@localhost:~$ sudo sl
Password:
sysadmin@localhost:~$

Learn about user permissions for files and directories

Permissions
●
Permissions determine the ways users can interact a file or directory. 
●
When listing a file with the ls -l command, the output includes permissions.
●
Recall that the permissions are in the first field after the file type character:  
⁠  
-rw-rw-r-- 1 sysadmin   sysadmin    21 Aug 1  02:35 hello.sh                    

Permissions
●
Permissions are broken down into three sets of three characters. 
○
Owner:
○
Group:
○
Others:
⁠  
-rw-rw-r-- 1 sysadmin   sysadmin    21 Aug 1  02:35 hello.sh                    
-rw-rw-r-- 1 sysadmin   sysadmin    21 Aug 1  02:35 hello.sh                    
-rw-rw-r-- 1 sysadmin   sysadmin    21 Aug 1  02:35 hello.sh                    

Permissions
●
There are three permission types:
Permission
Effect on File
Effect on Directory
Read (r)
Can read or copy file 
contents
Allows for listing of files
Write (w)
Can modify or overwrite file 
contents
Can modify directory 
contents (only with execute)
Execute (x)
Can run the file as a 
process
Can change (cd) to the 
directory if parent directory 
has execute also

How to change file and directory permissions

Changing Permissions
●
The chmod command is used to change the permissions of a file or directory. 
●
There are two techniques to change permissions using chmod ; the symbolic 
method and the octal method (not covered in this course). 
●
Symbolic Method:  
○
First indicate the <SET> using the following symbols:
■
u - User permissions
■
g - Group permissions
■
o - Other permissions
■
a - All permissions
Chmod [ <SET><ACTION><PERMISSIONS>]... FILE

Changing Permissions
○
Then specify the <ACTION> symbol:
■
(+) - Add the permission
■
(=) - Specify exact permission
■
(-) - Remove the permission
○
Specify one or more <PERMISSIONS> to be acted upon:
■
r - Read
■
w - Write
■
x - Execute
○
Lastly, specify the FILE or pathname to assign the permissions to. The action 
should resemble the following example:
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents$ chmod u+x hello.sh

How to change file and directory ownership

Changing Ownership
●
The chown command is used to change the ownership of a file or directory. 
●
To change the user owner of a file, use the following syntax:
●
For example, to change the owner of the hello.sh file from sysadmin to root:  
⁠  
chown [OPTIONS] [OWNER] [FILE]
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents$ ls -l hello.sh
-rw-rw-r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin 112 Aug  1 02:35 hello.sh
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents$ sudo chown root hello.sh
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents$ ls -l hello.sh
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root sysadmin 112 Aug  1 02:35 hello.sh
Don't forget to use the sudo command in order to gain the necessary administrative privileges. 

How to move files around the filesystem

Moving Files
●
The mv command is used to move a file from one location in the filesystem to 
another. 
●
The mv command requires at least two arguments; a source (file to be moved) 
and a destination (where the file will be moved):
●
For example, to move the people.csv file to the Work directory:  
⁠  
mv SOURCE DESTINATION
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents$ mv people.csv Work
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents$ ls Work
people.csv

How to create copies of files in the filesystem

Copying Files
●
The cp command is used to copy files.
●
Similar to the mv command, cp requires at least two arguments; a source (file 
to be copied) and a destination (where the file will be copied):
●
For example, to copy the /etc/passwd file to the current directory:  
⁠  
cp SOURCE DESTINATION
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents$ cp /etc/passwd .
Recall that . is a shortcut which represents the current directory.

Copying Files
●
The dd command is a utility used for copying files or partitions.
●
This command can be useful for a few reasons:
○
To clone or delete disk partitions
○
To copy raw data to removable devices (USB, CDROM...)
○
Backup your computer’s MBR (Master Boot Record)
○
Create files with binary zeros used for virtual memory
●
For example, using dd the following creates a file named /tmp/swapex with 50 blocks 
of zeros that are one megabyte in size: 
○
if = input file; of = output file; bs = byte size
sysadmin@localhost:~$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/swapex bs=1M count=50

How to remove files from the filesystem

Removing Files
●
The rm command is used to delete files and directories.
●
The  rm command without any options is used to remove files:
●
To delete a directory, use the -r or -R option with the rm command:  
⁠  
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents$ rm linux.txt
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents$ ls linux.txt
ls: cannot access linux.txt: no such file or directory
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents$ rm Work
rm: cannot remove ‘Work’: Is a directory
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents$ rm -r Work

How to view file contents 

Viewing Files
●
The cat command can be used to view the entire contents of a file:
●
The head command displays the first ten lines of a file. 
●
The tail command displays the last ten lines of a file.
●
The -n option can be used with head and tail to adjust the number of line 
displayed.
⁠  
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents$ cat food.txt
Food is good.
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents$ head alpha.txt
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents$ tail alpha.txt

How to filter file contents using regular expressions and basic 
patterns

Filtering Input
●
The grep command is a text filter that will search input and return matches of a pattern:
●
For example, to filter information about the sysadmin user in the passwd file, 
use sysadmin as the PATTERN argument and passwd as the [FILE]
argument:
⁠  
sysadmin@localhost:/Documents$ grep sysadmin passwd
sysadmin:x:1001:1001:System Administrator,,,,:/home/sysadmin:/bin/bash
grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE]

Filtering Input
●
Regular expressions (regex) are patterns that only certain commands can interpret.
●
Regular expressions can also be used with the grep command to filter file contents.
○
Basic regular expressions include:
.
Any one single character
*
Zero or more of the previous character
[ ]
Any one specified character
^
Pattern must be at beginning, or literal ^
[^ ] Not the specified character
$
Pattern must be at end, or literal $
○
Extended regular expressions include:
+
One or more of the previous pattern
( )
Used to create groups
{ }
Specify minimum, maximum, or
exact matches of previous pattern
|
Alternation (logical “or”)

Filtering Input
●
Regular expressions can be used with grep to match basic patterns in text.
●
Anchor Characters:
○
First anchor character ^ is used to ensure that the pattern appears at the beginning. 
○
Second anchor character $ is used to ensure that the pattern appears at the end.
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep '^root' /etc/passwd                        
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash  
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep 'r$' alpha-first.txt                       
B is for Bear
F is for Flower

Filtering Input
●
The . character will match any character (except newline) 
○
For example, the pattern r..f will return the following:
●
The [ ] brackets match a single character from a list or range contained in 
the brackets:
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep 'r..f' red.txt                             
reef
roof
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ grep '[0-9]' profile.txt                        
I am 37 years old.                                                              
3121991
I have 2 dogs.                                                                  
123456789101112

Filtering Input
●
The * character will match zero or more of a character preceding it.
○
For example, the pattern e* will match zero or more of the letter e and will 
result in the following:
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$  grep 're*d' red.txt                            
red
reeed
rd
reed

How to shutdown the Linux system

Shutting Down
●
The shutdown command brings down the system safely and notifies all users the 
system is going down. 
●
Formats of the TIME argument can be the word now, a time of day in the format hh:mm 
or the number of minutes to delay in the format +minutes.
⁠  
root@localhost:~# shutdown +1 "Goodbye World!"                                  
Broadcast message from sysadmin@localhost

Network Configuration
●
Systems are connected to a network in order to communicate to other systems (like the 
internet).
●
The ifconfig command is used to display network configuration information.
●
ifconfig can also used to modify network settings.
⁠  
root@localhost:~# ifconfig

How to view processes on the Linux system

Viewing Processes
●
Running a command results in a process.
●
In the Linux operating system, processes are executed with the privileges of 
the user who executes the command.
●
The ps command can be used to list processes:
⁠  
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ps                                                        
PID TTY          TIME CMD                                                     
87 ?        00:00:00 bash                                                    
128 ?        00:00:00 ps       

Viewing Processes
●
The output of the ps command includes the following columns of information:
○
PID: The process identifier, which is unique to the process. This information 
is useful to control the process by its ID number.
○
TTY: The name of the terminal where the process is running.
○
TIME: The total amount of processor time used by the process.
○
CMD: The command that started the process.

Learn about how software is installed on a Linux system

Package Management
●
Package management is a system by which software can be installed, 
updated, queried or removed from a filesystem.
●
In Linux, there are many different software package management systems.
●
The Debian Advanced Package Tool apt-get is a front-end program that 
makes package management easy for Linux beginners.
⁠  

Package Management
●
Package files are commonly installed by downloading them directly from repositories 
located on Internet servers.
●
Before installing a package, refresh the list of available packages using the apt-get 
update command.
●
To search for packages, you can use the apt-cache search command:
●
Once you've found the package that you want to install, you can install it with the apt-
get install command:
⁠  
sudo apt-get install [package] 
apt-cache search [keyword] 

Package Management
●
To update all packages
○
First update the cache of all packages available with apt-get update.
○
Second, execute the apt-get upgrade command.
●
The apt-get command is able to either remove or purge a package.
○
Purging deletes all package files, while removing deletes all but the 
configuration files.
○
To remove a package, use apt-get remove as an administrator
○
To purge a package, use apt-get purge as an administrator
⁠  

How to update a user’s password on a Linux system

Updating User Passwords
●
The passwd command is used to update user passwords.
●
Users can only change their own passwords, whereas the root user can update 
the password for any user.
●
To execute the passwd command use the following syntax:
●
You will be prompted to enter the existing password once and the new 
password twice.
⁠  
passwd [OPTIONS] [USER]

Updating User Passwords
●
To view status information about your password use the -S option with the passwd 
command:
○
sysadmin: User Name
○
P: Password Status (P indicates usable status, L indicates locked, NP means no password)
○
03/01/2015: Change Date (date when password was last changed)
○
0: Minimum (minimum number of days that must pass before the current password can be changed by 
the user)
○
99999: Maximum (the maximum number of days remaining for the password to expire)
○
7: Warn (the number of days prior to password expiry that the user is warned)
○
-1: Inactive (the number of days after password expiry that the user account remains active)
sysadmin@localhost:~$ passwd -S sysadmin
sysadmin P 03/01/2015 0 99999 7 -1                                                           

Learn about input/output redirection on the command line

Redirection
●
Input/Output redirection allows for information in the command line to be sent to files, 
devices, and other commands.
●
There are three type of input/output:
○
Standard Input (STDIN): Information the command receives and processes when it 
is executed.
○
Standard Output (STDOUT): The output of the command.
○
Standard Error (STDERR): Error messages generated by commands that are not 
correctly executed.
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls
Desktop Documents Downloads Music Pictures Public Templates Videos
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls fakefile
ls: cannot access fakefile: No such file or directory

Redirection
●
STDOUT can be used to write to files by redirecting command output to a file.
●
For example, the output of the cat command can be redirected to a new file called 
newfile1.txt:
●
The single > character will overwrite any contents of a file, so to append content to a file 
use the double-greater than characters >>.
[COMMAND] > [FILE]
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cat food.txt
Food is good.
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cat food.txt > newfile1.txt
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cat newfile1.txt
Food is good. 

Learn about Linux text editors

Text Editors
●
There are numerous text editors in Linux (nano, emacs, vi)
●
The most advanced text editor for Linux is called vi. Benefits of vi include:
○
Available on every Linux distribution in the world.
○
Can be executed both in a CLI (command line interface) and a GUI (graphical user 
interface).
○
Core functions have been around for decades.
●
To get started using vi, type the command followed by the pathname to the file to edit 
or create:
⁠  
sysadmin@localhost:~$ vi newfile.txt

Text Editors
●
There are three modes used to navigate and edit in vi:
○
command mode
○
insert mode
○
ex mode
●
Command Mode
○
Used to type commands that move around a document, manipulate text, and to access 
the other two modes.
○
Command Mode Movement
■
Movement commands in vi use a motion and an optional number prefix.
■
For example, 5h would move the cursor five characters to the left.
■
Some other movement commands include:
 
 
j - down one line 
l - right one character 
b - one word back
 
 
k - up one line 
w - one word forward 
^ - beginning of the line $ - end of the line
 
 
$ - end of the line

Text Editors
●
Command Mode Actions
○
vi uses the following three action commands:
■
d - Delete (cut)
■
y - Yank (copy)
■
p - Put (paste)
●
The following syntax is used for command mode:
○
For example:
■
d3w will delete the next three words
■
yw will yank the current word
⁠  
action [count] motion

Text Editors
●
Insert Mode
○
Insert mode is used to add text to the document.
○
There a few ways to enter insert mode from command mode
 
a - Enter insert mode after cursor 
                  i - Enter insert mode before cursor
 
A - Enter insert mode at end of line 
                  I - Enter insert mode at beginning of line
 
o - Enter insert mode on blank line after cursor        O - Enter insert mode on blank line before cursor
●
Ex Mode
○
Used to view or change settings, as well as carry out file-related commands like opening, 
saving or aborting changes to a file.
○
To get to ex mode, type a : character in command mode.
■
For example, :w will write (save) the file to the filesystem; :q! will quit without saving.
