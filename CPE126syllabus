14. Other Course Policies
a. Attendance
According to CHED policy, total number of absences by the students should not be more than
20% of the total number of meetings or 9 hrs for a three-unit-course. Students incurring more
than 9 hours of unexcused absences automatically gets a failing grade regardless of class
standing.
b. Guided Learning Output
Guided learning outputs through various worksheets in each cluster of topics are assigned to the
students. Problems encountered in the worksheets will be discussed in class.
c. Written Examination
Exams will be given face to face for Tri-X, Bio-X and Blended modes and online for UOX.
d. Course Portfolio
Selected guided learning outputs and examinations are to be compiled and collected before the
end of the term. The selection is based on statistical data gathering (lowest, median, highest).
Guided learning outputs and examinations with marks lowest, median, and highest must be
photocopied and must be given back to the instructor for course portfolio keeping.
e. Language of Instruction
Lectures, discussion, and documentation will be in English. Written and spoken work may receive
a lower mark if it is, in the opinion of the instructor, deficient in English.
f. Dress and Grooming Codes
All of us have been instructed on the Dress and Grooming Codes of the University.

g. Academic Integrity Policy
It is the student’s responsibility to refrain from infractions of academic integrity, from conduct that
may lead to suspicion of such infractions, and from conduct that aids others in such infractions.
Any of the following sanctions may be imposed to any student who is found guilty of committing
online academic dishonesty:
a. Failed mark in the course.
b. Suspension for a period of less than one term, with or without community service.
c. Suspension for a period of one term or more, with or without community service.
d. Non-readmission to the University.
e. Dismissal from the University.
f. Expulsion.
The following are considered academic dishonesty:
1. Using another MyMapua email address to login to any platform (such as BlackBoard and
Coursera) with or without permission.
2. Asking or hiring someone else to do their exams, homework, Coursera course, papers,
projects, or other academic requirements.
3. Recording and saving copies of exam questions or answers, or answer keys for distribution.
4. Receiving copies of exam questions or answers, or answer keys to an exam from someone
who has already taken it.
5. Plagiarizing or the unethical act of stealing the thoughts of another without proper citation or
reference, acquiring information from the Internet without acknowledging the author, copying
from another student’s work without permission and submitting it as own work.
6. Massive, pre-meditated, organized online cheating using instant messaging/email during a quiz
or exam.
7. Any form of dishonesty in peer-reviewed assignments/submissions (e.g. Coursera peer-graded
submissions).
8. Engaging in any activities that will dishonestly improve results, or dishonestly improve or
damage the results of others.
9. Any other form of dishonesty or cheating in any assessment or course requirement.
All students who will violate the Academic Integrity Policy of the university will be given zero mark
for the exam or for the activity and will be given a failing grade for the course. He or she will also
be referred to the Prefect of Discipline for appropriate sanction.
h. Consultation Schedule
Consultation schedules with the Professor are posted outside the EECE Faculty room and in the
school webpage (http://eece.mapua.edu.ph). It is recommended that the student first set an
appointment to confirm the instructor’s availability.
i. Appeal system
All appeals on student assessment must be made by the concerned student within one week after
the return of the assessed student work.
In case the student is not satisfied, no later than one week after the decision of the faculty has
been made, he can elevate the appeal to the program chair or dean in case there is no program
chair. The decision of the program chair or dean is final. The faculty must abide with the moderated
decision of the program chair or dean.

j. Use of generative AI
It is expected that students will adhere to generally accepted standards of academic honesty,
including but not limited to refraining from cheating, plagiarizing, misrepresenting one’s work,
and/or inappropriately collaborating. This includes the use of generative AI tools that have not
been cited or documented or authorized. Students will also be expected to adhere to the
prescribed professional and ethical standards of the profession/discipline for which the student is
preparing. Any student who engages in academic dishonesty or who violates the professional and
ethical standards for the profession/discipline for which the students.
